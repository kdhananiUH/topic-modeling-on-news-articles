WASHINGTON -- President Trump is shifting more authority over military operations to the Pentagon, according to White House officials, reversing what his aides and some generals say was a tendency by the Obama White House to micromanage issues better left to military commanders.

The change is at the heart of a re-engineering of the National Security Council's role under its new leader, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and reflects Mr. Trump's belief that the N.S.C. should focus less on military operations and tactics and more on strategic issues. A guiding precept for the president and his team is that the balance of power in the world has shifted against American interests, and that General McMaster should focus on developing foreign and economic policy options in concert with the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies to respond to that challenge.

The new approach to managing military operations was evident this month when a Marine artillery battery and a team of Army Rangers -- some 400 troops in all -- arrived in northern Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed off on the deployments and notified the White House. But General McMaster neither convened a meeting at the White House to discuss whether to send the forces nor presented the Pentagon with questions about where, precisely, the troops would operate or what risks they might confront.

Though the streamlined decision-making has been welcomed by many in the military, it could raise questions about whether Mr. Trump, who has drawn heavily from current and former generals to fill key jobs in his administration, is exercising sufficient oversight.

''For President Trump, it is very early days, but he appears to be going back to a model of greater delegation of authority,'' said Michèe A. Flournoy, who was the Pentagon's top policy official under President Barack Obama and is the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based policy group.

''The benefit is that it allows the military campaign to go forward without undue pauses, interruptions or delays,'' Ms. Flournoy added. ''That enables it to create more momentum and to be more responsive to changes on the battlefield. But there is a risk if there is inadequate oversight and the president stops playing close attention. It can be detrimental, even dangerous, if a commander in chief does not feel ownership of the campaign or loses touch with how things are evolving on the ground.''

Mr. Trump has already drawn criticism for being quick to approve the military's plans to carry out a raid in Yemen in January that led to the death of one American commando and at least several civilians. The United States also conducted an airstrike last week in Syria that the American military said killed dozens of Qaeda fighters but that local activists said hurt civilians.

At the same time, Mr. Trump has yet to announce a new strategy to defeat the Islamic State, something he repeatedly said during the presidential campaign that he would do. That suggests that Mr. Trump's main contribution may be to ensure that the basic strategy he inherited is carried out more quickly.

General McMaster -- who replaced a retired general, Michael T. Flynn, whose tumultuous tenure as national security adviser lasted less than a month -- has a reputation as a strategic thinker. So far, he has not undertaken any fundamental restructuring of the N.S.C., according to White House officials who did not want to be identified because they were discussing internal planning. But he has made some appointments to assist in the effort to forge a new strategy.

Dina Powell, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for economic initiatives, has been named the deputy national security adviser for strategy to spearhead the preparation of policy options and oversee their execution once Mr. Trump decides on them.

Nadia Schadlow, a former Pentagon official and the author of a recent book that examined cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, was hired to draft a security strategy. In the past, that document has often been little more than a rehash of the White House's policies, but for a Trump administration struggling to translate its promise to ''make America great again'' into a coherent foreign and economic agenda, it might emerge as an important statement.

How General McMaster will navigate rival centers of power within the White House that have their own deep-seated views on security policy remains to be seen. When Mr. Mattis hosted the Saudi defense minister at the Pentagon on Thursday, General McMaster was one of five White House officials who attended the meeting. The others were Stephen K. Bannon, who remains a full member of the National Security Council's ''principals'' committee; Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law; Ms. Powell; and Derek Harvey, the chief Middle East expert on the N.S.C. staff.

''General McMaster's problem is not how to deal with defense secretary and other principals; it is how to deal with the many competing powers in the White House,'' said Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the co-author of a book on the National Security Council. ''That was underscored when five senior White House officials traipsed over to the Pentagon for a meeting that normally might be attended by a single N.S.C. aide.''

An immediate focus for General McMaster, however, is making good on Mr. Trump's vow during his speech to a joint session of Congress last month to ''demolish and destroy'' the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Trump, who claimed during the campaign to have a secret plan to defeat the militant group, instructed the Pentagon and other key agencies in late January to submit a preliminary plan within 30 days to do so.

More than seven weeks later, no new strategy has been announced, and there has been some speculation that the White House will not decide one key question -- whether to arm the Kurdish Y.P.G. militia in Syria -- until after a Turkish referendum on April 16 on whether to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. While American commanders generally believe that the militia would greatly help what is expected to be a hard-fought operation to take Raqqa, Syria, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State, Turkey has denounced the group as a terrorist organization.

The steps the Trump administration has taken so far, such as deploying Marine artillery in Syria, generally reflect the Obama administration's approach of providing firepower and advisers so local forces can do the main fighting on the ground.

But while it still expects the White House to be consulted, the Trump administration is prepared to give the Pentagon more leeway in deploying forces than the Obama administration did. The Obama White House's scrutiny of military deployments reflected its fear of being drawn into a quagmire, as well as strains with the military that went back to 2009 deliberations over Afghanistan strategy.

While the approach the Obama administration took ensured that the president was well-informed on military details, it also meant that modest steps, such as resupplying arms to Syrian fighters battling the Islamic State or sending military teams to scout out a potential base in Iraq, often could not be taken without time-consuming deliberations.

''In defense of the Obama administration, every single time we went to the president and asked for something more, we eventually got it, though we often had to jump through a lot of hoops,'' said Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who held a senior position at the Defense Department under Mr. Obama. ''The episode that took the cake was toward the end of the administration, when we literally had cabinet secretaries debating the movement of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.''

While it remains unclear whether the new administration will come up with a strategy significantly different from its predecessor's, the Trump team may have an effect on how the one it inherited is carried out.

''Potentially, by giving field commanders more leeway to exploit opportunities on the battlefield, the Trump administration can execute the Obama administration's strategy more efficiently,'' Mr. Exum said.

Politics is something like an art, if you ask those who practice it, and it's something like a science, if you ask those who study it. But to the journalists who cover it, it has always been something like something else: a sport. Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. ''The kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform,'' he wrote. ''The quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form.'' The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise ''journalistic conscience''; it had internalized a ''racehorse philosophy.''

Nearly half a century later, Rokeach's assessment still echoes in our gripes about political news. His chosen metaphor, however, has been beaten to death. Coverage is now turning away from a language of sports and toward a language of war. The horse race has given way to an arms race, in which everything, and everyone, have the potential to be ''weaponized.''

According to the past year in headlines, Donald Trump has amassed a particularly enormous arsenal. Since the beginning of the election, he has been credited with improvising (or trying to improvise) weapons out of everything within reach: Twitter, ''the dollar,'' conspiracy theories, ''fake news,'' harassment, Bill Clinton, emails, the media, ''merry Christmas,'' federal funding, unintelligibility and chaos -- to name just a few. Trump's opponents have taken up arms, too. Among the weaponry: ''Hillary Clinton's popular-vote victory,'' history, social media, protest and ''Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim election rhetoric'' (which was ''weaponized'' in court arguments against the travel restrictions he ordered). The left has been accused of weaponizing political correctness, weaponizing ''safe spaces'' and weaponizing racism -- meaning accusations of racial hatred, not racial hatred itself.

''Weaponization'' works as a throwing up of the hands, and as a suggestion -- or an admission, or a strategic claim -- that the discourse has failed us. Or, more accurately, it suggests that the discourse has become something dangerous: no mere fight but a terminal conflict without decorum or limits. The language of sports had a maddening tendency to flatten and trivialize the serious consequences of politics, creating constant suspense but obscuring life-or-death stakes. Militarized language moves in a different direction: It intensifies the news it's describing while simultaneously obscuring actual threats. ''Weaponization'' is used to describe both rhetoric that might incite violence and criticism of violent rhetoric. It is lodged against the state, with its legal monopoly on violence, but also, incoherently, against those who challenge the state. It is a shortcut to false equivalence, and it manufactures excuses for those with a vested interest in drawing blood themselves.

As a metaphor, ''weaponization'' creates paranoia and the impression that nothing is immune from conscription. Suddenly tools for violence are hiding everywhere, waiting to be brandished by your enemies, taken up for self-defense or fatally mishandled by the blind or naïe. The fabric of civilian life is now wrapped in a linguistic fog of war.

''Weaponize'' was born in the 1950s as military jargon. It was an instantly comprehensible neologism, useful and compact and inflected with the managerial style then in vogue. ''To turn into a weapon'' sounds clumsy and crude, bringing to mind early man gripping a fist-size rock or a prisoner sharpening a toothbrush. ''Weaponize,'' on the other hand, conjures thick-rimmed glasses and pomade, official reports and secret plans. It's a contemporary of ''collateral damage,'' another term emblematic of what had not yet been termed the military-industrial complex.

Its first documented appearance in front of a wide audience came in 1957, in an Associated Press interview with Wernher von Braun, the former Nazi engineer who would become an integral figure in the American space program. Von Braun explained to the unnamed reporter that his work had been to ''weaponize'' the military's ballistic-missile technology. Army rocketry was, of course, always destined for war, so von Braun's use of the word suggested the fulfillment of a plan, more than a conversion. Over the decades that followed, ''weaponization'' proliferated alongside nuclear warheads, describing their constantly multiplying delivery systems, and lingered through the late stages of the Cold War. But it has periodically re-entered the lexicon to address fresh fears: anxiety about new infectious diseases being put to sinister ends; weapons of mass destruction, during the run-up to the first and second American wars in Iraq; and of course, 21st-century terror attacks, in which horrifying and surprising things -- passenger planes, trucks -- were converted into instruments of slaughter.

Recently, as the word has crept into civilian life to describe an anxiety about the future, it has brought uncanny echoes of history along with it. In that 1957 interview, von Braun used the word in response to a question about the Soviet Union's technological advantages. Today it is Russia that is described -- by American intelligence figures -- as leading the way in a very different form of cutting-edge weaponization: of hackers, leaks, data dumps, social media and information in general, all aided by the machinery of the internet. This rhetorical conversion of the entire internet into a field of battle dovetails neatly with our deepening fears about technology and privacy. The notion that a state could weaponize social media for political ends is easy to understand in the familiar terms of online harassment, which turns seemingly inert platforms like Twitter or Facebook into tools for invading privacy and inflicting fear. Similarly, a nation using malware to interfere with a rival power's missile launches resembles, more than superficially, a hacker's plot to conscript your wireless baby monitor into a malicious botnet, and worries about pervasive state surveillance bring to mind our ambivalent relationships with the online services to which we hand over our most personal information. Both lines of thinking look at our technological, social and political acceleration with an extreme but appealingly simple pessimism: Whatever this is, it ends badly.

This feeling can breed either cynicism or paranoia, calling into question not just different claims about the world but also the tools used to make them. ''Weaponized Narrative Is the New Battlespace,'' blared a January headline on Defense One, a website that covers national-security news. ''Weaponized narrative seeks to undermine an opponent's civilization, identity and will by generating complexity, confusion and political and social schisms,'' the article says, repeating the claim that Russia ''controlled'' the United States presidential election with disinformation and hacked data. The global rise of blood-and-soil nationalism, it suggests, is a result of ''attacks'' meant to ''tear down old identities that have bound us together.''

Russia Insider, a website broadly defensive of the country's government, treated the subject with mockery. The Western media, it wrote in March of last year, was sounding paranoid: ''Whatever You Can Think Of, Russia Is 'Weaponizing' It.'' Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks -- another entity frequently accused of weaponizing information -- returned the favor in February: ''When you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponized text.''

In the months since the election, as our linguistic arms race has continued to escalate, less metaphorical weapons have inauspiciously rejoined the discourse: consumer drones in Mosul, the VX nerve agent in a Malaysian airport and, in North Korea, the original weaponized weapons, ballistic missiles. Seeing these headlines side by side with articles about the weaponization of data (to win elections) and of Hollywood (to criticize the president) doesn't feel as strange as you might expect. Of course quadcopter drones have been weaponized. We're at war. Haven't you heard? They're weaponizing tweets now.

But even as a metaphor, far away from missiles and drones and nerve agents, weaponization is disorienting. That social media can be described within a single year as having been ''weaponized'' by Barack Obama and by ISIS, by and against Hillary Clinton, by governments and by brands, by Donald Trump and by the protesters challenging him, by bots and marketers and malicious trolls targeting other users with explicitly violent threats -- all of this is a testament to how ''weaponization'' scrambles power in ways that tend to favor the actually violent. It places weapons in the hands of everyone around them, annexing their targets into a war zone where anything is permissible.

Arrests and New Toll in Afghan Siege

KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghan officials sharply increased the tally of dead in an attack last week on a military hospital, saying Wednesday that at least 50 people, including patients and staff members, were killed.

In addition, 24 people have been arrested in connection with the March 8 attack, including Afghan generals, according to Lt. Gen. Helaludin Helal, the country's deputy minister of defense for strategic and intelligence affairs. The arrests were for a variety of charges including negligence, incompetence and complicity, General Helal said at a contentious news conference.

The news conference was called after Afghan news reports and social media accounts suggested that the casualty toll was actually in the hundreds; that three hospitalized Afghan generals were among those killed by the attackers; and that the minister of defense, Abdullah Habibi, had personally signed the V.I.P. vehicle pass that allowed the attackers to enter the heavily guarded hospital complex in a car packed with explosives and weapons.

The reports seemed to be fueled partly by contradictory government claims immediately after the attack that only two people had died, a number many officials stuck to even after personnel at the Ministry of Defense confirmed that at least 31 people were dead.

In addition, it took the authorities seven hours to quell the attack, leaving the armed insurgents prowling Sardar Daud Khan Hospital for hours, hunting down patients and medical staff members in the 400-bed facility, which is usually full or nearly so.

General Helal maintained that the news reports in general were distorted and incorrect, without getting into specifics. As the questioning grew heated, General Helal abruptly left, leaving the Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, to take over.

General Waziri confirmed that officials were investigating the possibility that the attack was carried out by insiders, but he did not directly address assertions that doctors working at the hospital were involved. He did not identify the generals who were arrested, and did not say how many generals were arrested or what the charges were.

He confirmed that the attackers brought their vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla, into the hospital compound in Kabul using an official pass, which he described as ''fake.''

One of the five attackers detonated their explosives-laden car with a remote-controlled device as they entered the hospital grounds dressed in white medical clothing, according to the official accounts. They then carried out the attack using guns, grenades and suicide vests, at least one of which detonated.

The authorities said all five attackers were killed, but Afghans have widely questioned that assertion as well, and raised questions about whether wounded Taliban prisoners who had been in the hospital might have escaped.

The victims' names have not been made public by the government, further fanning speculation about a higher death toll. Some names have emerged. One victim was Gen. Daud Askaryar, who recently retired after six years as head of the National Police Academy, according to his son, Mohammad Maroof Askaryar, who was visiting him at the time of the attack and hid in a bathroom to escape being killed. His father, he said, was stabbed to death through his oxygen tent in the intensive care unit.

''The number of those killed is way higher than 50,'' said Jawed Kohistani, a former general who is a military analyst with wide connections among the Afghan security forces.

A retired general who is currently a member of Parliament, Nazifa Zaki, also disputed the official figure. ''I believe 200 people were martyred in the hospital,'' Ms. Zaki said. ''This is what I heard from eyewitnesses and those who went to the hospital and funerals of the martyred.''

Much of the public ire has been directed at the country's defense minister, General Habibi, a former Communist-era general appointed by President Ashraf Ghani, especially after reports that the general had signed the vehicle pass for the attackers.

Members of Parliament have derided General Habibi, who is 64, for apparently sleeping through official meetings in the middle of a war, charges backed up by photos posted on local social media posts showing him apparently dozing off on the job. One shows him sleeping next to Mr. Ghani at an official function.

''He should just go to a mosque and catch up on his sleep,'' said Allah Gul Mujahid, another member of Parliament. ''We need shrewd and active generals to lead the forces. This is not the place for him.''

Afghans were also critical of the country's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, for posing for selfies with soldiers in front of the hospital immediately after the attack.

The furor over the military hospital attack has underscored public disenchantment with the coalition government. It has struggled for more than a year to agree on a defense minister, and is two years overdue on holding national elections for Parliament.

The military situation has steadily worsened in the meantime, with historically high casualties on the government side; more and more districts that are dominated by insurgents; and growing numbers of Afghans who have been displaced by fighting.

The Islamic State claimed on one of its websites that it was responsible for the hospital attack, while the Taliban denied any role. Government officials, however, have blamed the Taliban, and General Helal said ''we cannot deny'' that one of the attackers shouted, ''Long live the Taliban.''

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has a relatively small number of fighters in Afghanistan, mostly in the eastern province of Nangarhar. And while their members have carried out attacks in Kabul -- such as one last July at a protest that killed 80 people -- the hospital assault was more complex and sophisticated than anything the group has done before in Afghanistan.

KABUL, Afghanistan —fghan officials sharply increased the tally of dead in an attack last week on a military hospital, saying Wednesday that at least 50 people, including patients and staff, were killed.

In addition, 24 people have been arrested in connection with the March 8 attack, including Afghan military generals, according to Lt. Gen. Helaludin Helal, the country’ deputy minister of defense for strategic and intelligence affairs. The arrests were for a variety of charges including negligence, incompetence and complicity, General Helal said at a contentious news conference.

The news conference was called after Afghan reports and social media accounts suggested that the casualty toll was actually in the hundreds; that three hospitalized Afghan generals were among those killed by the attackers; and that the minister of defense, Abdullah Habibi, had personally signed the V.I.P. vehicle pass that allowed the attackers to enter the heavily guarded hospital complex in a car packed with explosives and weapons.

The reports seemed to be fueled partly by contradictory government claims immediately after the attack that only two people had died, a number many officials stuck to even after personnel at the ministry of defense confirmed at least 31 people were dead.

In addition, it took the authorities seven hours to quell the attack, leaving the armed insurgents prowling Sardar Daud Khan Hospital for hours, hunting down patients and medical staff in the 400-bed facility, which is usually full or nearly so.

General Helal maintained that the news reports in general were distorted and incorrect, without getting into specifics. As the questioning grew heated, General Helal abruptly left, leaving the defense ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, to take over.

General Waziri confirmed that officials were investigating the possibility that the attack was carried out by insiders, but he did not directly address assertions that doctors working at the hospital were involved. He did not identify the generals who were arrested, how many generals were arrested or what the charges were.

He confirmed that the attackers brought their vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla, into the hospital compound using an official pass, which he described as “ake.”

One of the five attackers detonated their explosives-laden car with a remote-controlled device as they entered the hospital grounds dressed in white medical clothing, according to the official accounts. They then carried out the attack using guns, grenades and suicide vests, with one or more detonated.

Authorities said all five attackers were killed, but Afghans have widely questioned that assertion as well, and raised questions about whether wounded Taliban prisoners who had been in the hospital might have escaped.

Correction Appended

On the campaign trail, no foreign policy issue seized Donald Trump more than the fight against the Islamic State. Once president, he signed an executive order giving his generals 30 days to produce a plan to defeat the terrorist group, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis gave him options on Feb. 27.

Yet if Mr. Trump has decided on a new plan for defeating \b ISIS\b0 , it isn’ obvious. The missions underway in Iraq and Syria were set in motion by President Barack Obama. While they have achieved some tactical successes, they point to a deepening American military involvement in both countries. The question now is whether Mr. Trump will continue, or accelerate, that trend.

Last week, American officials announced plans to nearly double their forces in Syria with 400 more troops and the Pentagon is reportedly considering sending 1,000 extra troops to Kuwait as a reserve force. They are also weighing more troops for Iraq, where about 5,000 Americans are training and assisting Iraqi security forces. Though the Americans are not expected to be involved in ground combat, they are moving closer to the front lines.

As a candidate, Mr. Trump derided Mr. Obama’ anti-ISIS strategy as a disaster, though offering none of his own. Now, in office, he shouldn’ ignore the progress that has been made. Local forces backed by American airstrikes have retaken large areas of Syria and Iraq that ISIS captured in 2014. The eastern part of Mosul, once Iraq’ second-largest city, was recently liberated from ISIS. On Feb. 19, Iraqi forces launched a battle for the western part of the city, where a million people are trapped in desperate conditions. Last week, an American-backed militia in Syria captured the main road connecting Raqqa to territory the group holds in Deir al-Zour Province, severing the last supply and escape route for its fighters. The group’ claim to legitimacy has rested mainly on holding territory, so losing those strongholds would be a devastating blow.

Meanwhile, many terrorist fighters have been killed and fewer replacements are arriving from other countries. ISIS’inances —rom oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control —ave fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to no more than $870 million in 2016, according to a study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence.

One of the tough questions facing Mr. Trump is whether to arm the Syrian Kurds for the fight against ISIS. American military commanders consider them crucial partners in any campaign to retake Raqqa, where some 4,000 ISIS fighters are dug in. The problem is that Turkey, a NATO ally, opposes arming the Syrian Kurds because it considers them terrorists in league with the Kurds who are waging a separatist war in Turkey. If they are not armed, the battle for Raqqa would be delayed, and momentum lost. If the decision goes against Turkey, it could retaliate by banning the United States from Incirlik Air Base.

On the diplomatic front, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has wisely chosen to retain the top Obama administration official in charge of the global anti-ISIS coalition and has scheduled a meeting of its members this month in Washington. There is much to discuss, including how to meet the basic needs of civilians displaced by ISIS and ways to govern and secure war-ravaged communities. This is critical, because ISIS, even if it is beaten militarily, can be expected to recruit new members and pose a threat for years to come. Sadly, Mr. Trump isn’ helping by reissuing his anti-Muslim visa ban, which only reinforces ISIS’nti-West message.

Correction: March 13, 2017, Monday

Trump Administration Is Said to Be Working to Loosen Counterterrorism Rules

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is exploring how to dismantle or bypass Obama-era constraints intended to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks, commando raids and other counterterrorism missions outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.

Already, President Trump has granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an ''area of active hostilities'' where looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the largest-ever series of American airstrikes targeting Yemen-based Qaeda militants, starting nearly two weeks ago, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such battlefield-style zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the Qaeda-linked group the Shabab, they said.

Inside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the Obama-era rules, said the officials, who described the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.

The move to open the throttle on using military force -- and accept a greater risk of civilian casualties -- in troubled parts of the Muslim world comes as the Trump administration is also trying to significantly increase military spending and cut foreign aid and State Department budgets.

The proposal to cut so-called soft-power budgets, however, is meeting with stiff resistance from some senior Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as from top active-duty and retired generals and admirals, who fear perpetual conflicts if the root causes of instability and terrorism are not addressed.

''Any budget we pass that guts the State Department's budget, you will never win this war,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said during a hearing last week. Referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he added, ''As a matter of fact, ISIL will be celebrating.''

In a sign of mounting concern over the government's policy review, more than three dozen members of America's national security establishment have urged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to maintain the thrust of the Obama-era principles for counterterrorism missions, saying strict standards should be maintained for using force outside traditional war zones.

The former officials, in a letter sent on Sunday to Mr. Mattis, warned that ''even small numbers of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries -- whether or not legally permitted -- can cause significant strategic setbacks,'' increasing violence from militant groups or prompting partners and allies to reduce collaboration with the United States.

Indeed, immediately after the Special Operations raid on Jan. 29, Yemeni officials suspended further commando missions, pending an assessment of what went wrong, although they later backtracked.

The letter's 37 signatories included John E. McLaughlin, who was the acting C.I.A. director for President George W. Bush; Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama's Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser; and Matthew G. Olsen, who served as a national security official in the Bush Justice Department and as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama administration.

The White House did not respond to a request for an interview about this article.

Mr. Obama imposed the civilian-protection rules in May 2013 as part of an effort to recalibrate counterterrorism operations after he had overseen a steep increase in military and C.I.A. drone strikes in places like Yemen and tribal Pakistan.

Critics, including inside the government, worried that the strikes were causing too many civilian casualties, driving terrorist recruitment and undermining support among local partners in the regions. In response, the Obama administration developed the rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance.

Under those rules, cabinet officials generally must agree in high-level deliberations that a proposed target away from a traditional war zone poses a threat to Americans. That is intended to limit strikes targeting generic groups of suspected low-level foot soldiers. And there must be ''near certainty'' that no civilians will be killed.

By contrast, in a standard war zone, military commanders can approve a strike without interagency review in Washington, and some civilian casualties are acceptable under the laws of war, as long as they are deemed necessary and proportionate to a legitimate military objective.

Military operators have chafed under the 2013 rules, but the Obama administration saw them as a signature accomplishment in the era of drones and open-ended war on terrorism. In his last year in office, Mr. Obama issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose annually its official estimate of civilian and combatant deaths from counterterrorism airstrikes away from war zones.

Still, in its final year in power, the Obama administration declared the area around Surt, Libya, to be an ''area of active hostilities.'' It then started a sustained campaign of 495 airstrikes targeting Islamic State militias there. Mr. Obama revoked the Surt declaration hours before Mr. Trump's inauguration.

The Obama administration also permitted the Defense Department to carry out an escalated campaign of airstrikes last year in Somalia that the United States Africa Command started without going through the process laid out by the 2013 rules. Instead, those airstrikes were justified under an expansive theory of collective self-defense to protect African Union and Somali forces being trained and advised by the United States.

Against that backdrop, officials said, both the Central Command, which oversees military activity in Yemen, and Africa Command, which oversees it in Somalia, had already been developing proposals by mid-2016 to ask for parts of Yemen and Somalia to be declared active-hostilities zones, officials said. They submitted those to the Joint Chiefs of Staff's ''J5'' directorate, which handles strategic plans and policy.

As a result, the Pentagon was in a position to swiftly bring the ideas forward to Mr. Trump, whose inauguration raised expectations that the White House would be more permissive. The officials said that Mr. Mattis signed one-page memos to Mr. Trump asking for each authority, backed by about five pages of supporting material, within days of Mr. Trump's becoming president in January.

Several officials said Mr. Trump signed off on making parts of Yemen an active-hostilities zone at the same dinner with Mr. Mattis five days after his inauguration where he approved the ill-fated raid on a Qaeda compound in Yemen. At the time, they said, the expectation was that the Somalia proposal would be swiftly signed, too, and that the larger 2013 rules could be jettisoned swiftly.

On Jan. 28, Mr. Trump signed a presidential national security memorandum directing the military to give him a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State. It said the plan should include ''recommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force,'' a veiled reference to rescinding the 2013 limits on airstrikes.

But the momentum for rapid change broke, the officials said, after the Yemen raid, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths, including of children; the death of a member of the Navy's SEAL Team 6 and the wounding of three others; and the loss of a $75 million aircraft.

As a result, Mr. Trump's national security advisers -- first Michael T. Flynn, who has since resigned, and now Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster -- have slowed the review process down while letting operations in Yemen, and soon Somalia, play out as test runs, the officials said.

On the campaign trail, no foreign policy issue seized Donald Trump more than the fight against the Islamic State. Once president, he signed an executive order giving his generals 30 days to produce a plan to defeat the terrorist group, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis gave him options on Feb. 27.

Yet if Mr. Trump has decided on a new plan for defeating \b ISIS\b0 , it isn’ obvious. The missions underway in Iraq and Syria were set in motion by President Barack Obama. While they have achieved some tactical successes, they point to a deepening American military involvement in both countries. The question now is whether Mr. Trump will continue, or accelerate, that trend.

Last week, American officials announced plans to nearly double their forces in Syria with 400 more troops and the Pentagon is reportedly considering sending 1,000 extra troops to Kuwait as a reserve force. They are also weighing more troops for Iraq, where about 5,000 Americans are training and assisting Iraqi security forces. Though the Americans are not expected to be involved in ground combat, they are moving closer to the front lines.

As a candidate, Mr. Trump derided Mr. Obama’ anti-ISIS strategy as a disaster, though offering none of his own. Now, in office, he shouldn’ ignore the progress that has been made. Local forces backed by American airstrikes have retaken large areas of Syria and Iraq that ISIS captured in 2014. The eastern part of Mosul, once Iraq’ second-largest city, was recently liberated from ISIS. On Feb. 19, Iraqi forces launched a battle for the western part of the city, where a million people are trapped in desperate conditions. Last week, an American-backed militia in Syria captured the main road connecting Raqqa to territory the group holds in Deir al-Zour Province, severing the last supply and escape route for its fighters. The group’ claim to legitimacy has rested mainly on holding territory, so losing those strongholds would be a devastating blow.

Meanwhile, many terrorist fighters have been killed and fewer replacements are arriving from other countries. ISIS’inances —rom oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control —ave fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to no more than $870 million in 2016, according to a study by the research organization RAND.

One of the tough questions facing Mr. Trump is whether to arm the Syrian Kurds for the fight against ISIS. American military commanders consider them crucial partners in any campaign to retake Raqqa, where some 4,000 ISIS fighters are dug in. The problem is that Turkey, a NATO ally, opposes arming the Syrian Kurds because it considers them terrorists in league with the Kurds who are waging a separatist war in Turkey. If they are not armed, the battle for Raqqa would be delayed, and momentum lost. If the decision goes against Turkey, it could retaliate by banning the United States from Incirlik Air Base.

On the diplomatic front, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has wisely chosen to retain the top Obama administration official in charge of the global anti-ISIS coalition and has scheduled a meeting of its members this month in Washington. There is much to discuss, including how to meet the basic needs of civilians displaced by ISIS and ways to govern and secure war-ravaged communities. This is critical, because ISIS, even if it is beaten militarily, can be expected to recruit new members and pose a threat for years to come. Sadly, Mr. Trump isn’ helping by reissuing his anti-Muslim visa ban, which only reinforces ISIS’nti-West message.

Trump Administration Is Said to Be Working to Loosen Counterrorism Rules

WASHINGTON —he Trump administration is exploring how to dismantle or bypass Obama-era constraints intended to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks, commando raids and other counterterrorism missions outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.

Already, President Trump has granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an “rea of active hostilities”here looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the largest-ever series of American airstrikes targeting Yemen-based Qaeda militants, starting nearly two weeks ago, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such battlefield-style zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the Qaeda-linked group Al Shabab, they said.

Inside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the Obama-era rules, said the officials, who described the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.

The move to open the throttle on using military force —nd accept a greater risk of civilian casualties —n troubled parts of the Muslim world comes as the Trump administration is also trying to significantly increase military spending and slash foreign aid and State Department budgets.

The proposal to cut so-called soft-power budgets, however, is meeting with stiff resistance from some senior Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as from top active-duty and retired generals and admirals, who fear perpetual conflicts if the root causes of instability and terrorism are not addressed.

“ny budget we pass that guts the State Department’ budget, you will never win this war,”enator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said during a hearing last week. Referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he added, “s a matter of fact, ISIL will be celebrating.”

In a sign of mounting concern over the government’ policy review, more than three dozen members of America’ national security establishment have urged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to maintain the thrust of the Obama-era principles for counterterrorism missions, saying strict standards should be maintained for using force outside traditional war zones.

The former officials, in a letter sent on Sunday to Mr. Mattis, warned that “ven small numbers of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries —hether or not legally permitted —an cause significant strategic setbacks,”ncreasing violence from militant groups or prompting partners and allies to reduce collaboration with the United States.

Indeed, immediately after the Special Operations raid on Jan. 29, Yemeni officials suspended further commando missions, pending an assessment of what went wrong, although they later backtracked.

The letter’ 37 signatories included John E. McLaughlin, who was the acting C.I.A. director for President George W. Bush; Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama’ homeland security and counterterrorism adviser; and Matthew G. Olsen, who served as a national security official in the Bush Justice Department and as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama administration.

The White House did not respond to a request for an interview about this article.

Mr. Obama imposed the civilian-protection rules in May 2013 as part of an effort to recalibrate counterterrorism operations after he had overseen a steep increase in military and C.I.A. drone strikes in places like Yemen and tribal Pakistan.

Critics, including inside the government, worried that the strikes were causing too many civilian casualties, driving terrorist recruitment and undermining support among local partners in the regions. In response, the Obama administration developed the rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance.

Under those rules, cabinet officials generally must agree in high-level deliberations that a proposed target away from a traditional war zone poses a threat to Americans. That is intended to limit strikes targeting generic groups of suspected low-level foot soldiers. And there must be “ear certainty”hat no civilians will be killed.

By contrast, in a standard war zone, military commanders can approve a strike without interagency review in Washington, and some civilian casualties are acceptable under the laws of war, as long as they are deemed necessary and proportionate to a legitimate military objective.

Military operators have chafed under the 2013 rules, but the Obama administration saw them as a signature accomplishment in the era of drones and open-ended war on terrorism. In his last year in office, Mr. Obama issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose annually its official estimate of civilian and combatant deaths from counterterrorism airstrikes away from war zones.

Still, in its final year in power, the Obama administration declared the area around Surt, Libya, to be an “rea of active hostilities.”t then started a sustained campaign of 495 airstrikes targeting Islamic State militias there. Mr. Obama revoked the Surt declaration hours before Mr. Trump’ inauguration.

The Obama administration also permitted the Defense Department to carry out an escalated campaign of airstrikes last year in Somalia that the United States Africa Command started without going through the process laid out by the 2013 rules. Instead, those airstrikes were justified under an expansive theory of collective self-defense to protect African Union and Somali forces being trained and advised by the United States.

Against that backdrop, officials said, both the Central Command, which oversees military activity in Yemen, and Africa Command, which oversees it in Somalia, had already been developing proposals by mid-2016 to ask for parts of Yemen and Somalia to be declared active-hostilities zones, officials said. They submitted those to the Joint Chiefs of Staff’ “5”irectorate, which handles strategic plans and policy.

As a result, the Pentagon was in a position to swiftly bring the ideas forward to Mr. Trump, whose inauguration raised expectations that the White House would be more permissive. The officials said that Mr. Mattis signed one-page memos to Mr. Trump asking for each authority, backed by about five pages of supporting material, within days of Mr. Trump’ becoming president in January.

Several officials said Mr. Trump signed off on making parts of Yemen an active-hostilities zone at the same dinner with Mr. Mattis five days after his inauguration where he approved the ill-fated raid on a Qaeda compound in Yemen. At the time, they said, the expectation was that the Somalia proposal would be swiftly signed, too, and that the larger 2013 rules could be jettisoned swiftly.

On Jan. 28, Mr. Trump signed a presidential national security memorandum directing the military to give him a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State. It said the plan should include “ecommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force,” veiled reference to rescinding the 2013 limits on airstrikes.

But the momentum for rapid change broke, the officials said, after the Yemen raid, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths, including of children; the death of a member of the Navy’ SEAL Team 6 and the wounding of three others; and the loss of a $75 million aircraft.

As a result, Mr. Trump’ national security advisers —irst Michael T. Flynn, who has since resigned, and now Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster —ave slowed the review process down while letting operations in Yemen, and soon Somalia, play out as test runs, the officials said.

Allies Worry U.S. Is Abandoning Traditional Role as Moral Authority

CORRECTION APPENDEDPARIS -- When the State Department released its annual human rights report last week, it contained many of the usual tough American judgments of other countries. Iran was criticized for restricting freedom of religion and the media; Russia for discriminating against minorities; Eritrea for using torture; Bulgaria for violence against migrants and asylum seekers. The list went on.

What was notably missing this year, however, was the usual fanfare around the report and a news conference promoting it by the new secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, as Democratic and Republican administrations have almost always done.

The State Department dismissed criticism of Mr. Tillerson's absence, which came even from some Republicans. But for observers of American foreign policy, it was hard not to interpret the low-key rollout as another step by the Trump administration away from America's traditional role as a moral authority on the world stage that tries to shape and promote democratic norms, both for their intrinsic value and to create a more secure world.

Interviews with more than a dozen former diplomats, professors, human rights advocates and international politicians, both abroad and in the United States, suggested that the United States under President Trump was poised to cede not only this global role, but also its ability to lead by example.

Many pointed out that America's own actions over the years have already eroded its moral standing -- Guantáamo Bay, the use of torture on suspected terrorists and the civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, to name a few.

But Mr. Trump's administration stands alone, many experts said, for the divisiveness of its tone toward minorities and the media at home and toward Muslims and migrants abroad, its disparagement of NATO and the European Union and its praise of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which have blurred distinctions between allies and enemies.

Mr. Trump himself recently put the United States on the same moral plane as Russia, when the Fox News talk show host Bill O'Reilly protested during an interview that Mr. Putin was a killer.

''There are a lot of killers,'' Mr. Trump quickly responded. ''We've got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country's so innocent?''

The comment alarmed many because it underscored an approach by Mr. Trump, like the rejection of migrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries, that has stripped much of the moral component from American foreign relations and left him being lectured by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and others about his duties under international law.

Her foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, has gone one step further, reminding America of its moral duty as the most powerful Western country and one founded by Christian refugees.

''The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,'' he said recently. ''This is what unites us in the West and this is what we want to make clear to the Americans.''

Behind the rhetoric is the idea that moral authority -- as amorphous and idealistic as that can sound -- has imbued America with a special kind of clout in the world, with a power that is different from that wielded by autocrats and dictators or by big countries like Russia and China.

While the Soviet-era dominance across Eastern Europe undoubtedly was undermined by an expensive Cold War arms race with the United States, it was the Western Democratic system and America that many people looked to emulate, former diplomats said.

''The Berlin Wall didn't come down because people were responding to American howitzers,'' said Joseph Nye, a former senior State Department official and now a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''It came down under hammers and bulldozers wielded by people whose minds had been affected by the ideas of the West.''

The acting State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, rejected any suggestion that the United States was walking away from its international obligations or that the administration's statements and policies to date had diminished America's standing.

''We've signaled at every level our continued commitment to NATO,'' he said. ''On Russia, Secretary of State Tillerson has been clear that we would cooperate with Russia wherever possible, but not at the expense of Ukraine or Syria.''

''As for the new executive order,'' he added, ''this administration isn't ignoring the plight of refugees or discouraging people from visiting the U.S. It is simply making the security of the American people its No. 1 priority and instituting a temporary pause so that we can evaluate and ensure our vetting processes are as strong as they can possibly be. In short, American diplomacy plays an important role in American security, a security which promotes our prosperity.''

Not all are so convinced. Though in its early stages, Mr. Trump's presidency has for many called into question what kind of role America aims to play in the world, and even whether it wants to remain an example for other countries. Abandoning that role will have consequences, some are warning.

If America no longer presents an image of religious tolerance -- a core component of its moral standing -- it undermines its ability to make needed alliances, several diplomats said.

''Even in the days of George W. Bush, there was no feeling that Bush was against Muslims,'' said Marwan Muasher, a former foreign minister of Jordan and now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he is vice president for studies and oversees research on the Middle East.

''By contrast,'' he said, ''Mr. Trump's administration has seemed almost to revel in its anti-Islamic sentiments. There is no effort on the administration's side to reverse that image. There's no empathy toward the region in any way.''

For Hoshyar Zebari, a former foreign minister of Iraq, the initial decision to issue the migrant ban and include Iraq was utterly puzzling as well as deeply unfair, given how many Iraqis had fought on the same side as the Americans against the Islamic State and its precursors in Iraq.

Mr. Trump does seem to have been convinced of the importance of Iraq's role in the fight against Islamic extremism, and the latest version of his immigration ban includes six predominantly Muslim countries, leaving Iraq off the list. Still, the anti-Muslim rhetoric ''has emboldened extremists that this is the true face of America,'' Mr. Zebari said.

Some of the policies Mr. Trump seems eager to pursue may also compromise America's ability to lecture China about more tolerance toward Tibetan Buddhists or Uighurs, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about a free news media or tolerance of the Kurds, they noted.

Not everyone agrees that Mr. Trump's approach is a startling departure from America's values, however.

Hubert Vérine, a former French foreign minister, noted that while Barack Obama may have been ''more elegant'' and ''refined'' in his words, he pursued many policies similar to Mr. Trump's, like urging NATO members to do more.

''One cannot describe the international system before Trump as working very well,'' Mr. Vérine said. ''It's not as though it was a paradisiacal, idyllic world, and abruptly Trump appeared like some kind of Attila.''

Yet the idea of a moral component in American identity dates back to the pilgrims. The notion became a particularly strong principle in foreign policy after World War I, with the United States playing a leading role in the creation of global organizations.

That moral strand was strengthened by World War II, not only because of America's part in helping to vanquish the Nazis, but also its postwar efforts to help rebuild Europe and form the United Nations.

Now, as America looks at minimizing its commitments to NATO and the European Union, there is the sense that it can no longer be counted on as a reliable partner.

''The most burning question overseas is, 'Can we rely on the United States to keep its commitments, can we rely on you to lead in the way we expect, are you going to consider the interests of your allies when new deals are made?''' said Michèe Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration.

Instead, Mr. Trump seems intent to pursue a ''what's in it for us?'' approach to foreign policy much closer to that of Russia, where threats and lethal power are its chief points of leverage and where international relations are often viewed as a zero-sum game. Where that leads is anyone's guess.

''What is very different is that the Trump administration says very bluntly that 'America has no responsibility in the world and it will pull back,''' said Laurence Nardon, who runs the North America program at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris, a prominent think tank.

''Trump will still do things, but in a transactional way,'' she added. ''He will fight ISIS because it's perceived as a true and real danger to the United States, and he'll do deals that benefit the country, but not out of any sense of moral responsibility to help the rest of the world.''

“he Berlin Wall didn’ come down because people were responding to American howitzers,”aid Joseph Nye, a former senior State Department official and now a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. “t came down under hammers and bulldozers wielded by people whose minds had been affected by the ideas of the West.”

The acting State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, rejected any suggestion that the United States was walking away from its international obligations or that the administration’ statements and policies to date had diminished America’ standing.

“e’e signaled at every level our continued commitment to NATO,”e said. “n Russia, Secretary of State Tillerson has been clear that we would cooperate with Russia wherever possible, but not at the expense of Ukraine or Syria.”

“s for the new executive order,”e added, “his administration isn’ ignoring the plight of refugees or discouraging people from visiting the U.S. It is simply making the security of the American people its No. 1 priority and instituting a temporary pause so that we can evaluate and ensure our vetting processes are as strong as they can possibly be. In short, American diplomacy plays an important role in American security, a security which promotes our prosperity.”

Not all are so convinced. Though in its early stages, Mr. Trump’ presidency has for many called into question what kind of role America aims to play in the world, and even whether it wants to remain an example for other countries. Abandoning that role will have consequences, some are warning.

If America no longer presents an image of religious tolerance — core component of its moral standing —t undermines its ability to make needed alliances, several diplomats said.

“ven in the days of George W. Bush, there was no feeling that Bush was against Muslims,”aid Marwan Muasher, a former foreign minister of Jordan and now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he is vice president for studies and oversees research on the Middle East.

“y contrast,”e said, “r. Trump’ administration has seemed almost to revel in its anti-Islamic sentiments. There is no effort on the administration’ side to reverse that image. There’ no empathy toward the region in any way.”

For Hoshyar Zebari, a former foreign minister of Iraq, the initial decision to issue the migrant ban and include Iraq was utterly puzzling as well as deeply unfair, given how many Iraqis had fought on the same side as the Americans against the Islamic State and its precursors in Iraq.

Mr. Trump does seem to have been convinced of the importance of Iraq’ role in the fight against Islamic extremism, and the latest version of his immigration ban includes six predominantly Muslim countries, leaving Iraq off the list. Still, the anti-Muslim rhetoric “as emboldened extremists that this is the true face of America,”r. Zebari said.

Some of the policies Mr. Trump seems eager to pursue may also compromise America’ ability to lecture China about more tolerance toward Tibetan Buddhists or Uighurs, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about a free news media or tolerance of the Kurds, they noted.

Not everyone agrees that Mr. Trump’ approach is a startling departure from America’ values, however.

Hubert Vérine, a former French foreign minister, noted that while Barack Obama may have been “ore elegant”nd “efined”n his words, he pursued many policies similar to Mr. Trump’, like urging NATO members to do more.

“ne cannot describe the international system before Trump as working very well,”r. Vérine said. “t’ not as though it was a paradisiacal, idyllic world, and abruptly Trump appeared like some kind of Attila.”

Yet the idea of a moral component in American identity dates back to the pilgrims. The notion became a particularly strong principle in foreign policy after World War I, with the United States playing a leading role in the creation of global organizations.

That moral strand was strengthened by World War II, not only because of America’ part in helping to vanquish the Nazis, but also its postwar efforts to help rebuild Europe and form the United Nations.

Now, as America looks at minimizing its commitments to NATO and the European Union, there is the sense that it can no longer be counted on as a reliable partner.

“he most burning question overseas is, ‘an we rely on the United States to keep its commitments, can we rely on you to lead in the way we expect, are you going to consider the interests of your allies when new deals are made?’”aid Michèe Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration.

Instead, Mr. Trump seems intent to pursue a “hat’ in it for us?”pproach to foreign policy much closer to that of Russia, where threats and lethal power are its chief points of leverage and where international relations are often viewed as a zero-sum game. Where that leads is anyone’ guess.

“hat is very different is that the Trump administration says very bluntly that ‘merica has no responsibility in the world and it will pull back,’”aid Laurence Nardon, who runs the North America program at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris, a prominent think tank.

“rump will still do things, but in a transactional way,”he added. “e will fight ISIS because it’ perceived as a true and real danger to the United States, and he’l do deals that benefit the country, but not out of any sense of moral responsibility to help the rest of the world.”

U.S. Adding 400 Troops in Syria to Support Assault on  ISIS  Stronghold

WASHINGTON -- The United States is sending an additional 400 troops to Syria to help prepare for the looming fight for Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate, American officials said on Thursday.

The increase, which includes a team of Army Rangers and a Marine artillery unit that have already arrived in Syria, represents a near-doubling of the number of American troops there.

The United States military has declined to say how many troops it has deployed in Syria. The formal troop cap is 503, but commanders have the authority to temporarily exceed that limit.

The Rangers' presence became apparent last weekend when they were seen driving around the northern Syrian town of Manbij in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees. The Washington Post earlier reported the deployment of the Marine artillery battery.

''We are preparing logistical and fire support to enable a successful assault on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of ISIS,'' said Col. John L. Dorrian, a spokesman for the American-led command that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

''The exact numbers and locations of these forces are sensitive in order to protect our forces, but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to defeat ISIS in Raqqa,'' Colonel Dorrian added.

The military strategy that is emerging in Syria parallels the approach that the United States has taken in Mosul, Iraq, and largely reflects the assumptions that guided the planning during the Obama administration.

In Mosul, the Americans and their allies have provided the air power, rocket fire, artillery and advisers, enabling Iraqi forces to move forward in their push to take the city's western half.

Similarly, in the case of Raqqa, the idea is that Syrian forces will do most of the ground fighting but that Americans will assist them with advisers and firepower.

The United States is already carrying out airstrikes in Syria and has deployed Himars surface-to-surface rockets in the northern part of the country. Before he left office, President Barack Obama approved the use of a small number of Apache attack helicopters, and they are expected to be part of the Raqqa operation, as well.

Now, Marine artillery is being added, along with logistical support and training and protection in dealing with improvised explosive devises.

Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, told reporters on Thursday that he was open to asking for more conventional military units if they are needed.

''I feel very comfortable with mixing Special Operations forces with conventional forces,'' General Votel said. ''That is the way we fight.''

One big hole in the strategy concerns which fighters will actually seize Raqqa. American commanders favor a mixed force of Syrian Arabs and the Kurdish Y.P.G. militia. But Turkey objects to arming the Kurds, a group it has denounced as terrorists.

The American military hopes it can mollify the Turks by making sure that the majority of the force that takes the city is Arab, and making clear that only local fighters will occupy the city after the Islamic State is driven out.

But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who recently visited Syria and Turkey, questioned whether these assurances would be enough to ease the concerns of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. His role is critical because he has allowed American warplanes to operate from the Turkish airfield at Incirlik and has sent Turkish troops into Syria.

''I'm not sure there's an understanding of how seriously Erdogan views this issue,'' Mr. McCain said in a Thursday hearing with General Votel.

''I think there's a possibility of an impending conflict between Turkey and the Kurds,'' Mr. McCain said.

Without providing details, General Votel responded, ''We are trying to take actions to prevent that from occurring.''

Turning to other regions, General Votel said he agreed the Afghan conflict was stalemated and supported the appeal from the American commander in Afghanistan for additional troops.

Regarding Yemen, General Votel said that he bore full responsibility for a January raid that was mounted to acquire intelligence about Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. One American commando was killed, and civilians perished in the cross-fire.

Mr. Trump has unwaveringly defended the value of the raid, but also told a Fox News interviewer that the operation was something the commanders ''wanted to do.''

Mr. McCain said that while the heroism of the Special Operations forces could not be challenged, the operation raised questions, including why the mission continued after encountering heavy fire and why the commandos had failed to capture any Al Qaeda operatives.

The American people, Mr. McCain said, need to be told the truth.

General Votel said that four to 12 civilian casualties resulted from the operation, providing lower casualty estimates than some analysts. After the hearing, General Votel acknowledged that United States commandos had hoped to capture some Al Qaeda operatives so it could interrogate them about the group's operations.

''We were trying to develop our understanding of the area and that includes the people as well as other materials,'' General Votel said.

Still, he told the lawmakers that he did not see the need for an additional government investigation of the mission.

In Iraq, as the fighting continued in Mosul, suicide bombers struck a village north of Baghdad as a wedding party gathered there, killing at least 26 people and wounding dozens, a government spokesman said on Thursday.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks late Wednesday, but suspicion has fallen on the Islamic State, The Associated Press reported.

Suicide Bombers Kill Dozens at Wedding Party in Iraq

BAGHDAD -- Suicide bombers struck a village north of Baghdad as a wedding party gathered in the evening, killing at least 26 people and wounding scores, a government spokesman said on Thursday.

The assault began late Wednesday when an assailant wearing an explosives-laden belt walked into the wedding party at an open area in Hajaj, near the city of Tikrit, about 120 miles north of Baghdad.

After the bomber detonated his explosives and people scrambled to help the wounded, a second assailant blew himself up at the scene, Ali al-Hamdani, a provincial spokesman, told The Associated Press.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, which wounded an estimated 67 people, but suspicion has already fallen on the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

The wedding party was being held for a family that had been displaced from Anbar Province, which is in western Iraq and is home to a tribe that opposes the Islamic State group.

Islamic State militants captured Tikrit during its blitz across Iraq in the summer of 2014, when the group seized nearly a third of the country.

Iraqi forces drove the militants from Tikrit in April 2015, but the Islamic State has continued to stage deadly attacks in and around the city.

It uses such assaults to distract from its losses as government forces try to retake all of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from militant control.

Over the past week, Iraqi forces have fought their way into the heart of western Mosul, which is separated from the eastern sector by the Tigris River, capturing a government complex and the city's antiquities museum, where militants have destroyed priceless relics.

Mosul also fell to the Islamic State in the summer of 2014, along with large parts of northern and western Iraq, but it is now the only significant urban area in the country under the group's control.

Arrest of  ISIS  Suspect in Rural Town Puts Australia on Edge

YOUNG, Australia -- On a rural road about two hours' drive from the nearest major city, the small Australian town of Young has long been known for cherries and little else. But in recent years, the once largely white, working-class community has seen a steady influx of Lebanese Muslim families, many who say they have relocated from Sydney for a better and safer life.

Among them are members of the Zahab family. Now one of them, Haisem Zahab, a 42-year-old electrician, is accused of using the internet to try to help the Islamic State develop a guided missile. Officials suspect that some of his relatives traveled to Syria to join the extremist group, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

The allegations about the Zahab family have rattled many residents of this town, who have long taken pride in its peaceful multiculturalism. They have also stoked some of the worst fears about homegrown links to terrorism in a country that is grappling with immigration policy and labor shortages.

''One argument developing is that Muslims cannot be trusted, they are all bad, and with so many in our town, it was only a matter of time before trouble raised its head,'' Craig Thomson, editor of The Young Witness, the local newspaper, wrote in an opinion column after Mr. Zahab's arrest. ''The other point put forward is that hatred is not the way to handle this situation and one man's actions should not condemn the entire town's Muslim population.''

The case is playing out as Australia contends with the same nationalist, anti-immigrant forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the American presidency and that prompted voters in Britain to approve a withdrawal from the European Union. Visiting Australia last year, Mutuma Ruteere, the United Nations special rapporteur on racism, condemned Australian politicians as engaging in ''xenophobic hate speech,'' and likened the country's mood to nationalist ideologies brewing in Europe and the United States.

Mr. Zahab was arrested, with his family present, in a raid at his property in Young on Feb. 28. He was accused of researching and designing a long-range guided missile and laser warning device for use by Islamic State militants.

Mr. Zahab's extended family had been under investigation for 18 months, and officials suspected that some of his relatives had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State and had sent money from the sale of their Sydney home to terrorists in Syria. A police report detailed how investigators believed the family had moved money to the Islamic State.

''Family members had access to a significant amount of funds in an Australian bank account and were suspected of using international travel cards and a computer consulting company based in the Middle East to remit funds out of Australia for the use and benefit of Islamic State in Syria,'' the report said, adding that members of the family were believed to have already traveled to Syria to become members of the terrorist group.

Mr. Zahab was charged with foreign incursion offenses, which are antiterrorism statutes that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. After Mr. Zahab's arrest, police officers spent days searching his 10-acre property, using metal detectors and digging up the yard in search of evidence.

Mr. Zahab is no stranger to law enforcement, having pleaded guilty previously to drugs and firearms charges. He is linked to a business called Oz Survival Gear, which is registered to the address that was raided by the police. The company sells items such as Swiss Army knives and flashlights, and it proclaims that ''a knifeless man is a lifeless man.''

Mr. Zahab was known as something of an outsider who rarely interacted with the local Lebanese Muslim community. But his arrest has sent some Muslim residents of Young into hiding, people in the community said.

Young's council administrator, Wendy Tuckerman, said that Mr. Zahab's arrest should not taint the rest of the community, which has ''a rich multicultural history.''

''It is important that we acknowledge that the scope of the arrest is limited to the actions of one individual,'' Mrs. Tuckerman said.

Muslim families first moved to the area more than two decades ago to work on cherry farms. John Barton, who was a real estate agent when some of the first Muslim families came to Young, remembers them buying several properties with orchards, and he has since watched those families grow and settle in.

''They've got shops in town -- coffee shops, a new kitchen shop, and the younger ones work in the big stores like Woolworths,'' Mr. Barton said. Local Muslim residents turned a former drive-in movie theater into a mosque, and they opened an Islamic school last year. ''They've added to the culture of the town,'' Mr. Barton said. ''It's a very friendly community.''

David McCabe, a local lawyer who has represented Muslim slaughterhouse workers in the area, said some of the families who relocated to Young did not want their children to grow up with the gang mentality fostered in parts of Sydney.

''Once they got to 15 to 17, they thought they'd lost control of them in western Sydney,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''And they thought they'd have a better chance of controlling them in the country.''

But Clarke Jones, an expert at Australian National University on terrorism and radicalization, said that Young's remoteness may have made it an attractive spot for hiding efforts to support foreign terrorist groups.

''Young was probably chosen as a destination because it's out of the radar of the usual police attention of Melbourne and Sydney,'' Dr. Jones said.

Dr. Jamal Rifi, a Muslim community leader in Sydney, called it unfortunate that the actions of one man could taint Australia's Muslims.

''That is symptomatic of what exactly's been happening in the last couple of years -- when the actions of a small number like this Young man'' discredit ''the Australian Muslim community at large,'' he said.

''It is a phenomena that's been happening across Australia,'' he added.

Mr. Zahab's arrest comes as Australians have been on heightened alert. The terrorism threat level in the country was elevated to ''probable'' in September 2014, and since then there have been four attacks tied to terrorism in Australia. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that a dozen more have been foiled and that more than 60 people have been charged as a result of counterterrorism operations across the country.

Of particular concern to many Australians is the rise in the number of terrorism suspects born and raised in the country. About 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with or engaged in terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, according to the Attorney General's Department. The government is working to strengthen laws to prosecute returning foreign fighters.

In recent days, Mr. Turnbull, who has seized on Mr. Zahab's arrest as ''yet another reminder of the enduring threat we face from Islamist terrorism,'' has ramped up his language, declaring his country's objective is to kill Islamic State fighters.

''Our goal as far as those who serve with Daesh in the Middle East is to kill them,'' he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ''Let me be quite frank -- that is our goal.''

But Dr. Jones, the terrorism expert, cautioned against vilifying a whole community based on the actions of one person.

''The more than 70 odd families that are there are hardworking, productive members of the Young community,'' he said.

The police searched the property of Haisem Zahab on the outskirts of Young, Australia, last week. He is accused of using the internet to try to help the Islamic State develop a guided missile. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MATTHEW ABBOTT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAP

Sessions Says Guantáamo Is a ‘ery Fine Place’or New Suspects

WASHINGTON —ttorney General Jeff Sessions said on Thursday that he would advise President Trump to send newly captured terrorism suspects to the wartime prison at Guantáamo Bay, Cuba, which he called “ very fine place,”ather than to bring them to civilian court for prosecution by the Justice Department he now runs.

“here’ plenty of space,”r. Sessions said of the prison. “e are well equipped for it. It’ a perfect place for it. Eventually, this will be decided by the military rather than the Justice Department. But I see no legal problem whatsoever with doing that.”

As a senator, Mr. Sessions was a critic of former President Barack Obama’ efforts to close the prison and his refusal to bring any new captives to it. But Mr. Sessions’ remarks, in an interview with the conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, were his first extensive public comments on the topic since becoming attorney general last month.

Mr. Hewitt did not raise the question of whether the United States would seek to take custody of Abu Khaybar, who is suspected of being a Qaeda militant and was captured last fall in Yemen by another country, nor what should happen to terrorism suspects who are American citizens. Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he was “ine”ith sending Americans to Guantáamo.

But Mr. Hewitt brought up the troubles of the military commissions system operating at Guantáamo, in which the death penalty case against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four others accused of conspiring in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been mired in years of pretrial hearings with no actual trial yet in sight.

Mr. Hewitt observed that the commissions system “s not getting them to trial”nd called it “ind of a scandal that no one has faced justice 15 years later.”e asked Mr. Sessions whether he expected to accelerate the process.

Mr. Sessions told Mr. Hewitt that he had asked a “ood question.”nd while the attorney general reiterated his support for the idea of military prosecutions of Qaeda members, he also said it was time to think through “o what extent we’e going to use military commissions.”

“e’e got to get the military on board,”r. Sessions said. “y now, we should have worked through all the legal complications that the Obama administration seemed to allow to linger and never get decided, so nothing ever happened. So it is time for us in the months to come to get this thing figured out and start using it in an effective way.”

Mr. Sessions did not explain what he thought the military had done wrong, nor what he was suggesting as an alternative. But he pointed out that there is no need to prosecute anyone at Guantáamo in the sense that the detainees can be held in open-ended detention without trial while the war continues.

And he spoke disparagingly of transferring the Sept. 11 case to civilian court, which the Obama administration wanted to do before Congress barred transferring detainees onto domestic soil for prosecution.

“n general, I don’ think we’e better off bringing these people to federal court in New York and trying them in federal court where they get discovery rights to find out our intelligence, and get court-appointed lawyers and things of that nature,”e said.

The two factors Mr. Sessions identified are not unique to civilian trials. The commissions system’ rules for discovery of intelligence are modeled after civilian courts’ules, which are set by the Classified Information Procedures Act. And defendants in the military commissions system get government-provided defense lawyers, too.

Mr. Sessions’ interview came in a week in which the Trump White House twice put forth false information about Guantáamo.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump falsely said on Twitter that “22 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield.”ut 113 of the 121 former detainees deemed to be “onfirmed”ecidivists by the intelligence community were transferred under the Bush administration.

At a briefing on Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had gotten that wrong, but then falsely said that “ost”eleases under former President George W. Bush were “ourt-ordered.”ut habeas corpus rulings accounted for only three of the 593 ex-detainees transferred by the Bush administration.

BAGHDAD —uicide bombers struck a village north of Baghdad as a wedding party gathered in the evening, killing at least 26 people and wounding scores more, a government spokesman said on Thursday.

The assault began late Wednesday when an attacker wearing an explosives-laden belt walked into the wedding party at an open area in Hajaj, near the city of Tikrit, about 120 miles north of Baghdad.

After the bomber detonated his explosives, a second attacker blew himself up after people had gathered to help the victims of the first blast, a provincial spokesman, Ali al-Hamdani, told The Associated Press.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which left about 67 people wounded, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL.

 ISIS  Leaders Said to Flee as Coalition Nears Raqqa

WASHINGTON -- As Syrian fighters backed by the United States close in on Raqqa, some of the Islamic State's leaders have fled their self-declared capital and are planning to carry on the fight from other sanctuaries in Syria and Iraq, an American defense official said on Wednesday.

The departure of some of the group's leadership does not mean that the battle to take Raqqa will be easy, the official said. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 fighters remain in the city.

To provide more firepower for the looming battle, a United States Marine artillery unit is being deployed in Syria, mimicking the approach the United States has taken to support Iraqi troops fighting to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

But the flight of some Islamic State leaders indicates that their loss of Raqqa would not signal the end of their struggle to preserve their pseudo-state. The group's fighters are expected to fight on in Deir al-Zour, a Syrian province south of Raqqa, and in Iraqi towns along the Euphrates River, as well as to try to administer their self-proclaimed caliphate from those places.

A detailed assessment of Islamic State fighting capabilities was provided by the American defense official, who could not be identified under the ground rules for the Pentagon briefing.

The overall picture the official painted of the Islamic State was of an organization losing significant amounts of territory but still determined to fight. All told, the militant group is estimated to have at least 15,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, although its flow of volunteers has shrunk to 100 a month or even fewer.

No more than 2,500 fighters are struggling to defend western Mosul and the nearby town of Tal Afar, where they are largely cut off by Iraqi forces from receiving supplies and reinforcements. Those fighters have used crude chemical weapons, including chlorine and low-grade sulfur mustard. But while the weapons have hurt civilians, American officials do not believe that they have been militarily effective.

The American-led command has concentrated on striking midlevel commanders to try to sow confusion in the Islamic State's ranks. The official said the group had lost 65 percent of the terrain that it controlled in Syria and Iraq at its peak.

Still, the official acknowledged, the Islamic State has the resources to carry on, including an abundant supply of weapons and cash that it stole from the Iraqi and Syrian authorities when the militant group swept across the countries in 2014. The resilience of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's leader, may also be a rallying factor. The American defense official said he was believed to be alive and to have left Mosul.

American officials appear confident that the Islamic State will be evicted from Iraq's major cities and towns within six months. One militant stronghold that the Iraqi government has yet to focus on is Hawija, west of Kirkuk. Iraqi troops bypassed the town, where the defense official said the Islamic State has as many as 1,000 fighters, in the rush to reach Mosul. In October, the militant group used the Hawija area as a springboard for a counterattack on Kirkuk, which was put down after a couple of days of bitter fighting.

The Islamic State has suffered the loss of Al Bab in northern Syria, which fell to Turkish forces and Turkish-backed Syrian militias on Feb. 23. The militants had used the town as a command center and relied on the network of roads there to distribute fighters and supplies.

Within the past week, Palmyra has also been recaptured by the Syrian government, with the help of Russian air power.

But the Islamic State is expected to fight hard in Raqqa, where it has fortified its positions with trenches, tunnels, minefields and houses rigged with explosives.

Raqqa, however, is not the whole story. Thousands of militants are still operating southwest of the city in oil-rich Deir al-Zour, and along the Euphrates in Iraq. The Syrian towns Mayadeen and Abu Kamal are still Islamic State strongholds, as is Qaim across the border in Iraq.

Far from abandoning their dream of a caliphate, Islamic State leaders appear to be making arrangements so that if Raqqa falls, some administrative functions can continue to be carried out in their remaining territory, which the group controls with an iron fist.

The Trump administration has yet to make clear whether it will arm Syrian Kurds for the fight to take Raqqa. Turkey objects to the prospect of assisting the Kurdish minority that straddles the border between the two countries. Another crucial decision is which Syrian groups will govern and secure the city once it is retaken.

One thing is clear, however. Retaking Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, would be a body blow to the Islamic State. And capturing Raqqa, a powerful symbol of its power, would be an enormous setback for the group. But more fighting would lie beyond, and the United States and its coalition will need a plan to deal with that.

After Deadly Attack on Kabul Hospital, ‘verywhere Was Full of Blood’

KABUL, Afghanistan —unmen disguised as medical staff members stormed the main military hospital in Kabul on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people and wounding dozens in an attack that was claimed by the Islamic State and that highlighted the country’ deteriorating security situation.

Afghan forces struggled for seven hours to evacuate the crowded hospital and end the siege, killing all of the perpetrators of the audacious attack, which was carried out in broad daylight in the center of the Afghan capital.

As the war in Afghanistan has escalated and security forces have suffered high casualty rates, the 400-bed Sardar Daud Khan hospital remains the main care center for wounded army soldiers. The hospital is busy on any given day, as the bodies of those who are killed around the country are also brought there for their families to pick up.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on Wednesday through its Amaq News Agency, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, hours after the Taliban denied involvement.

Last year, there was a record number of civilian and military casualties from fighting that continues to rage across the country. Much of the fighting has been waged by the Taliban, an insurgency emboldened by territorial gains in recent years, but a group affiliated with the Islamic State has also been trying to gain a foothold in the east of the country.

After repeated operations by Afghan forces and airstrikes by the United States military, the group has been reduced to about 700 fighters, according to United States military officials. Despite those losses, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for an increasing number of suicide missions in Kabul, the one on the hospital being the most sophisticated. The group’ deadliest attack left at least 80 people dead at a peaceful protest last summer.

The Islamic State, whose regional chapter covers Afghanistan and Pakistan and is largely made up of fighters from Pakistani tribal areas, also claimed responsibility for an attack on a shrine in southern Pakistan on Feb. 16 that killed more than 80 people.

The regional picture is complicated, analysts say, by the difficulty in determining whether attacks attributed to the Islamic State were actually carried out by the group, or if other established groups like the Haqqani network were responsible.

The attack in Kabul on Wednesday began around 9 a.m., a busy time for the hospital’ staff as well as for family members visiting loved ones. A suicide bomber on foot detonated his explosives at one of the hospital’ rear entrances, after which other attackers, believed to number four, entered the building.

Maj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, the spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, said the attackers had worn medical uniforms.

“hirty people have been killed, including hospital personnel and patients, and more than 50 have been wounded,”eneral Waziri said after the attack ended around 4 p.m.

Sediq Sediqqi, the spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said all the attackers had been killed.

Survivors recounted harrowing stories of hiding under beds and holding their breath, or of trying to escape through windows. Caretakers tried to evacuate patients on gurneys. Hundreds of family members waited anxiously for hours outside the police cordon.

Fazel Mohammed, 46, who works in the neurology department on the fifth floor, said he had been on duty the night before and was waiting for the morning handover when the initial explosion occurred.

“ heard firing in the corridor of the fifth floor, and I saw gunmen shooting everyone they saw,”r. Mohammed said. “hey hit one of our colleagues with a bullet in the chest, and they fired at a girl who was a relative of a patient. Then they shot a cleaner and then another guy.”

Mr. Mohammed said he and others tried to barricade themselves in one of the rooms. They stayed there for three hours before security forces rescued them.

Dr. Akramuddin Kakar, who was stuck in the hospital for most of the seven hours, said, “e understand that on the second, third, fourth and fifth floors, casualties were very high, because everywhere was full of blood.”

He added, “he attackers killed whoever they saw in the main building of the hospital.”

As the elite forces who cleared the building were leaving, civilians and men in military uniforms arrived in more than a dozen vans to donate blood — sign that the number of casualties could be higher than reported by the government.

The United Nations condemned the attack, asking all parties to respect medical sites.

“n behalf of the U.N. humanitarian agencies, I strongly emphasize that medical facilities, personnel and those receiving treatment must never be placed at risk and under no circumstances be subject to attack,”dele Khodr, the United Nations interim humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan, said in a statement.

“his attack marks an abhorrent new low —ressing in disguise to shoot at the sick and wounded is a cowardly, wicked act,”r. Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan’ ambassador to the United States, said in a statement. “hese are forces of evil the world must work together to defeat.”

The hospital attack comes at a difficult time for medical workers in Afghanistan. From January 2015 to last December, about 240 attacks against health facilities or medical personnel have been recorded, according to a new report by the nongovernmental organization Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict.

According to the United Nations, 3,498 civilians were killed and 7,920 were wounded in Afghanistan last year. Afghan officials say more than 6,200 Afghan soldiers and police officers were killed and more than 12,000 were wounded.

Top Generals Hold Talks to Head Off Syria Clashes

WASHINGTON -- The top American military officer met Tuesday with his Russian and Turkish counterparts to discuss how to avoid an unintended confrontation as forces from all three nations operate on an increasingly crowded battlefield in northern Syria.

The unusual three-way meeting was held in Antalya, Turkey. It brought together Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff; and their Turkish counterpart, Gen. Hulusi Akar.

The major purpose of the session was to discuss ''the fight against all terrorist organizations in Syria'' and ''the importance of additional measures for de-conflicting operations,'' a spokesman for General Dunford said in a statement.

The situation in northern Syria has become increasingly tense in recent days. Supported by American and Russian airstrikes, Turkish forces and Syrian militias supported by Turkey recently succeeded in taking the town Al Bab from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

But Turkey's main worry is not ISIS but ensuring that Syrian Kurds do not establish a ministate in northern Syria. That has spurred fears that Turkish troops and their allies in the Syria opposition might move to seize Manbij, a town in northern Syria that was taken from ISIS by Syrian Arab and Kurdish militias backed by the United States.

The fighters defending Manbij do not believe that the Turkish posture is mere saber-rattling. Abu Amjed, the head of the Manbij Military Council, said in an interview last week that his fighters were being shot at by Turkish troops and that he considered Turkey to be more of a threat than ISIS.

As the situation escalated, the Manbij Military Council has tried to pre-empt any Turkish offensive by striking a deal with Russia to turn nearby villages under its control over to Syrian government forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. As part of that deal, a Syrian government convoy with humanitarian aid began to make its way to Manbij, escorted by Russian armored vehicles, which halted just short of the town.

At the same time, American troops in Stryker fighting vehicles and armored Humvees flying large American flags began to appear in and around Manbij to dissuade Turkish-backed militias and other groups from attacking the area. The American troops include a unit of Army Rangers, who appear to have been sent to northern Syria from the base American forces use in Erbil, Iraq. It was an unusually public role for Army Rangers, who often prefer to operate in the shadows.

Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday that the American deployment was intended as a ''visible sign of deterrence and reassurance.''

''We are concerned about anybody who views Manbij as needing to be liberated,'' he added.

One American official described the situation around Manbij as a potential tinderbox. There have already been a couple of friendly fire incidents, including a Russian airstrike last week that hit Syrian Arab fighters trained by the Americans. The worry is that a small incident could rapidly escalate and undermine the American-backed push to capture Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State's self-styled caliphate.

''There is a need for an effective coordination in the efforts to clear Syria of all terror groups because so many countries are involved there,'' Binali Yildirim, the Turkish prime minister, said of the generals meeting. ''That's the real aim of the meeting.''

The challenge facing the United States and Turkey, however, goes well beyond drawing clear battle lines.

American Special Operations Forces regard the Y.P.G. -- the Syrian Kurdish militia that is officially known as the People's Protection Units -- as an effective battlefield ally whose participation is vital to roll back the Islamic State in Syria.

While President Trump has yet to decide the matter, American commanders have also argued for equipping the Y.P.G. with armored vehicles, heavy machine guns and anti-tank missiles so they could join the operation to seize Raqqa.

Turkey, which has cast the Kurdish militias as terrorists, has vociferously objected to such a move. The American military has tried to develop ways to reassure Turkey, including by increasing the number of Syrian Arabs that would be used to take Raqqa.

New Travel Ban Garners Same Verdict in Middle East: A Slap at Muslims

CAIRO —ighter, tighter and more carefully worded, the reworked travel ban announced by the Trump administration   on Monday aims to pass legal muster in the United States while meeting its stated objective of combating Islamist terrorism.

But in the Middle East, where its effects will be most keenly felt, the executive order was seen as boiling down to the same thing: a Muslim ban.

In Iraq  , where the initial ban had drawn the sharpest criticism, relieved officials welcomed President Trump’ decision to drop their country from the list of nations whose citizens will be barred from entering the United States for 90 days. That decision came after pressure from the State Department and the Pentagon —nd as American troops are working closely with Iraqi soldiers in the battle for Mosul  .

In a minor triumph, there were none of the earlier chaotic scenes of travelers and refugees being turned back at airports.

Yet in the other six countries still on Mr. Trump’ list, his decision to push ahead with the ban only stoked their sense of grievance and discrimination. Regional experts repeated earlier warnings that Mr. Trump’ order handed an easy propaganda victory to enemies and might ultimately weaken American security.

“he idea that this is a Muslim ban has been reinforced even further,”aid Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “slamic State will use this ban to say: ‘ told you so. They only mean you harm. They only see you as the enemy.’”

The six countries left on the list are among the poorest, most chaotic or most politically isolated in the Middle East, so their inclusion carries ostensibly low costs for the Trump administration. Libya   has multiple competing governments. Aid officials warn that Yemen  , consumed by civil war, is on the verge of famine. Syria  ’ vicious six-year conflict has left vast urban landscapes in ruins. Somalia   has been in a state of rolling chaos since 1991.

Iran   does not suffer domestic upheaval, but decades of diplomatic hostility with the West have left it political isolated.

Trump administration officials point out that parts of the banned countries have become havens for Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other groups, largely as a result of war and chronic instability. But by the same token, studies have shown that the citizens of those countries are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence, and have historically not posed a major risk to security in the United States.

According to the New America Foundation  , all 13 jihadist terrorists who have killed people in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, were American citizens or permanent residents. None had ties to the seven countries first singled out by Mr. Trump in January. A federal appeals court, rejecting that order, said his administration had produced “o evidence” linking citizens from the seven affected nations to terrorist acts in the United States.

Among citizens in the banned countries, the sense of injustice is compounded when they look at richer or more powerful neighbors, like Egypt or Saudi Arabia, whose citizens have carried out major attacks in the United States, yet which have escaped Mr. Trump’ censure because their governments are harder to push around.

“ou know what they say: When the wife commits adultery, hit the maid,”aid Abdel Bari Taher, a Yemeni political analyst speaking by telephone from the war-ravaged country  ’ capital, Sana. “hey are punishing Yemen and others because they are the weak ones. Meanwhile, all the Gulf states that funded terrorism carry on as usual.”

Mr. Taher said he had little doubt Mr. Trump’ ban was driven by domestic political considerations. “e is going after us just to please his right-wing supporters at home,”e said. Nonetheless, he added, it stung.

In Iraq  , the initial ban had been taken as a grievous insult from an ally it was supposed to be partnering with in the fight against the Islamic State. When the ban was announced in January, it prompted calls from some officials in Baghdad for Iraq to reciprocate with a ban on Americans entering Iraq, putting the American-backed prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, under political pressure to act.

The plight of military translators who had worked for the United States government and been promised resettlement in the United States provided a further focus for popular outrage.

Mr. Abadi, however, ultimately decided not to impose any restrictions on Americans and instead worked through back channels to have the ban overturned. On Monday, relieved officials said their approach had been vindicated.

“e were hoping for the decision to be reconsidered, and this is what has happened,”aid Jasim al-Jaf, Iraq’ minister of migration, in a telephone interview.

Still, it was equally likely that pressure from the Pentagon, which feared damage to the Islamic State campaign, played a significant part in Mr. Trump’ decision.

In the revised executive order issued Monday, Mr. Trump dropped a provision to bar Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, but will still freeze all refugee admissions for 120 days.

David Miliband , a former British foreign secretary who leads the International Rescue Committee aid agency, denounced that decision as a “istoric assault on refugee resettlement to the United States, and a really catastrophic cut at a time there are more refugees around the world than ever before,”he Associated Press reported.

Ms. Yahya, the analyst, said the refugee decision was part of the growing “oral and reputational toll”rom Mr. Trump’ actions in the Middle East. Yet there was not much of an immediate outcry in many countries —ossibly because, as elsewhere, citizens were becoming slowly used to a steady stream of far-reaching, yet often perishable, decisions from Mr. Trump’ White House.

Some have been tickled by American news media coverage of the simmering conflict   between Mr. Trump and the “eep state”— phrase more commonly associated with discussions about the Egyptian security services, or Pakistan’ Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency. Yet Mr. Trump’ assault on the news media as an “nemy of the people” has uncomfortable echoes in many countries, and some have taken the parallels to signify that the United States has entered an unwelcome phase.

“rump has taken America from its ivory tower to the level of a rotten banana republic,”ohamed Rageh Roweis, a Palestinian   analyst, wrote on a Twitter .

Even in unaffected countries, the ban has stoked the belief that the true goal of Mr. Trump and senior advisers like Stephen K. Bannon is to pursue a civilizational war against Muslims, rather than to combat terrorism.

“t doesn’ make any sense,”aid Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political-science professor at Cairo University. “hese terrorist groups are multinational organizations. If they want to attack the United States, they don’ have to send people from these six countries. They can just find someone from another country.”

Nour Youssef and Tim Arango contributed reporting from Cairo, and Falih Hassan from Baghdad.

WASHINGTON —resident Trump on Monday morning approved a new travel ban executive order, replacing the one he issued in January  that had spawned chaos nationwide and was blocked by federal courts. The new order bars entry of some people from six predominantly Muslim countries —ran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen —or 90 days and suspends entry of some refugees for 120 days. But it carves out many exceptions and is less sweeping than the original. The administration hopes that the narrower order will survive court challenges.

Here are some excerpts from the executive order, with comments by The New York Times. The full text of the order is available here .

It invokes a vague threat of terrorism.

“he screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures …”

This is toned down from Mr. Trump’ original order, which invoked the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, even though none of the 19 hijackers were refugees or nationals of the countries targeted by the directive, which had also included Iraq.

It defends the previous order against accusations of religious discrimination.

“xecutive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. …hat order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities —hoever they are and wherever they reside —o avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.”

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump flatly proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States. That evolved into his original order, which permanently barred Syrian refugees and temporarily barred entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, while prioritizing admission of refugees who are persecuted religious minorities —n exception that many understood to be an implicit reference to welcoming Christians from the Middle East. One of the federal judges who blocked the original order, citing its history and context, ruled that it likely amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination.

Iraq is off the list.

The “lose cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq’ commitment to combat ISIS, justify different treatment for Iraq.”

Mr. Trump’ original order blocked Iraqis, too, but his new one left them out. The Pentagon had lobbied the White House to drop Iraq from the list because the backlash was undermining the joint campaign to battle the Islamic State. The new order emphasizes that Iraqis who have battled ISIS have “arned enduring respect.”t also says that since the original order, Iraq has undertaken unspecified steps to improve travel documentation and information sharing.

It is vague about what it will achieve.

“he secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public safety threat.”

Obviously, officials screening visa applicants and refugees are already looking for security threats and already gather many types of information for that purpose. The order justifies undertaking this pause so officials can try to think up some additional category of information to ask for while vetting people from troubled countries.

It carves out numerous exceptions.

“otwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to Section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the commissioner’ delegee, may, in the consular officer’ or the CBP official’ discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer’ satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest.”

One of the controversies of Mr. Trump’ original order was that it swept too broadly, initially including green-card holders, people who already had valid visas, and refugees whose travel to the United States had already been approved. His new order specifically exempts numerous such categories of travelers. It also includes a potentially huge exception for everyone else: consular officials are empowered to permit new applicants to travel immediately on case by case.

It still curbs the refugee program, but not as much.

“he secretary of state shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the secretary of homeland security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers.”

The original order shut down entry by most refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees permanently. The new version is significantly watered down. Syrians are not singled out for a permanent ban, and refugees whose travel has already been approved may still come into the United States without delay. Like the original order, however, the new order caps the number of refugees who may be admitted each year at 50,000, down from 110,000 under President Barack Obama.

It calls for publicizing reports of terrorism crimes committed by foreigners.

“o be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest,”he government will compile and periodically publicize reports about “he number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States”nd acts of “ender-based violence against women.”t will also publicize “he immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.”

Mr. Trump is directing the government to generate a regular cycle of news stories focusing people’ attention on crimes committed by noncitizens.

Mr. Trump's original order blocked Iraqis, too, but his new one left them out. The Pentagon had lobbied the White House to drop Iraq from the list because the backlash was undermining the joint campaign to battle the Islamic State. The new order emphasizes that Iraqis who have battled ISIS have ''earned enduring respect.'' It also says that since the original order, Iraq has undertaken unspecified steps to improve travel documentation and information sharing.

It is vague about what it will achieve.

''The secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public safety threat.''

Obviously, officials screening visa applicants and refugees are already looking for security threats and already gather many types of information for that purpose. The order justifies undertaking this pause so officials can try to think up some additional category of information to ask for while vetting people from troubled countries.

It carves out numerous exceptions.

''Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to Section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest.''

One of the controversies of Mr. Trump's original order was that it swept too broadly, initially including green-card holders, people who already had valid visas, and refugees whose travel to the United States had already been approved. His new order specifically exempts numerous such categories of travelers. It also includes a potentially huge exception for everyone else: consular officials are empowered to permit new applicants to travel immediately on case by case.

It still curbs the refugee program, but not as much.

''The secretary of state shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the secretary of homeland security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers.''

The original order shut down entry by most refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees permanently. The new version is significantly watered down. Syrians are not singled out for a permanent ban, and refugees whose travel has already been approved may still come into the United States without delay. Like the original order, however, the new order caps the number of refugees who may be admitted each year at 50,000, down from 110,000 under President Barack Obama.

It calls for publicizing reports of terrorism crimes committed by foreigners.

''To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest,'' the government will compile and periodically publicize reports about ''the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States'' and acts of ''gender-based violence against women.'' It will also publicize ''the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.''

Mr. Trump is directing the government to generate a regular cycle of news stories focusing people's attention on crimes committed by noncitizens.

Muslim Ban Lite

President Trump was center stage when his administration hastily rolled out a sweeping travel ban targeting Muslims in late January, vowing it would ensure ''we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.''

He was out of sight on Monday as administration officials unveiled a downscaled, but still pernicious, version of the ban, which targets refugees and travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations. It's not hard to see why. The Muslim Ban Lite is an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration stumbled spectacularly in its first major attempt to deliver on a campaign promise.

And yet, as administration officials made the case on Monday for the revised measures, there was no hint of contrition and plenty of reckless fearmongering. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the president was exercising his ''rightful authority to keep our people safe.'' Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned, without providing context or evidence, that more than 300 people admitted to the United States as refugees had been investigated by the F.B.I. for possible terrorism links. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, meanwhile, lamented that ''our enemies often use our own freedoms and generosity against us.''

The administration has failed to make a reasonable -- let alone persuasive -- case for barring people from the six nations. Intelligence experts at the Department of Homeland Security found that ''country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity,'' according to a memo leaked to The Associated Press.

Yet, as Mr. Trump has pressed ahead with this dangerous campaign promise, he has missed his own deadline to unveil a secret plan to defeat ISIS. That plan remains a mystery.

The initial ban, which was imposed through an executive order issued on Jan. 27, locked out all travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It indefinitely suspended the admission of Syrian refugees and temporarily halted the entrance of all other refugees. The order indicated that Christian refugees would get priority over Muslims.

In February, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit blocked key portions of the original travel ban, rejecting the administration's arguments that the exclusions were lawful and necessary to keep the nation safe.

The new order no longer bans citizens of Iraq. It also exempts people from the remaining six countries who have a valid American visa. The revised ban includes no mention of religious preferences and makes the ban on Syrian refugees temporary. Like the initial order, the new one reduces the number of refugees the United States is willing to admit this year to 50,000, down from last year's ceiling of 110,000.

While it may disrupt fewer lives, the new ban, and its justification, conveys the same spurious messages: that Muslims are inherently dangerous and that resettling refugees represents a dire threat. As part of the new order, the government intends to disseminate data on ''honor killings'' committed by foreigners in the United States. This step, and Mr. Sessions's unsubstantiated claim about refugees under F.B.I. investigation, can be read only as a cultural smear.

Resorting to these bunker mentality tactics, which are being peddled with plenty of innuendo and little convincing evidence, will do lasting damage to America's standing in the world and erode its proud tradition of welcoming people fleeing strife. While these steps are being sold as a means to make the nation safer, they stand to do the opposite.

Iraqi Forces Enter Western Mosul, in Fierce Battle Against  ISIS

BAGHDAD —raqi forces trying to reclaim Mosul penetrated the western part of the city on Tuesday, retaking a bridge and several public buildings during heavy clashes with the Islamic State militants, officials said.

Civilians reported that the bombardment and gunfire were the heaviest since Feb. 19, the beginning of the operation to retake the western part of the city —he country’ second-largest, where roughly a million people are trapped and living in desperate conditions.

Soldiers recaptured a branch of the central bank, an archaeological museum that jihadists ransacked after taking the city in 2014, and the Hurriya Bridge, which crosses the Tigris River in the center of the city, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, a military spokesman, said by phone.

“e will never stop until we liberate Mosul entirely,”e said.

Lt. Gen. Raed Shakir Jawdat, the chief of the federal police, said that security forces had also retaken a government compound. A statement from the American-led coalition forces assisting the Iraqis gave a similar account of their progress.

The museum was a focus of worldwide attention after it was seized by Islamic State militants, who used sledgehammers and drills to smash artifacts in its collection. The destruction horrified scholars around the world.

Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir al-Muhammadawi, a spokesman for an elite unit of Interior Ministry troops, said that the buildings retaken from the Islamic State included a courthouse where militants had carried out whippings, stonings and beheadings, as well as a building where militants had thrown people to their deaths.

“he liberation of the government compound is a step forward for our forces, a vital motivating position for us,”eneral Muhammadawi said in an interview. “he international coalition’ airstrikes and drones have played a major role in accelerating the liberation of the city.”

It was not yet clear how lasting the gains would be. Although soldiers raised the Iraqi flag over the government compound, in the Dawasa neighborhood, they were later forced to retreat under heavy fire from Islamic State militants, The Associated Press reported.

The museum remained within the range of Islamic State snipers, making it vulnerable to a counterattack.

Social media accounts associated with the Islamic State reported that militants had set off three suicide bombs during the offensive.

Though the military advances were tenuous, government forces said that Tuesday represented a critical moment in their weekslong offensive to retake western Mosul.

The fighting, which included recapturing most of the city’ airport, has not been easy. It took Iraqi forces more than three months to gain control over eastern Mosul, and casualties there were heavy.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and the chief of staff of the country’ armed forces toured the headquarters of the operations command responsible for the offensive, just outside Mosul, on Tuesday to “eview the progress of security forces,”ccording to a statement.

The Hurriya, or Freedom, Bridge is the second of five bridges to be retaken by government forces. American-led airstrikes damaged all five bridges last year in a bid to isolate the militants in Mosul.

Mosul fell to the Islamic State in June 2014, along with large parts of the country’ north and west. It is the largest Iraqi population center still wholly or partly in the militant group’ control.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Tuesday that about 46,000 people had been displaced from their homes in Mosul since Feb. 19 —ncluding 13,350 on Friday alone —n the highest continuous displacement of civilians since October.

“ll people displaced from western Mosul have been accommodated either with family members or in camps or emergency sites, where they receive a tented plot, basic household supplies, hygiene kits and 30-day food rations,”he United Nations office said. Camp construction and the installation of water and sanitation services are underway south of Mosul, the office added.

Since Feb. 19, the office said, more than 500 people have been treated for conflict-related wounds, including 15 people who were hospitalized in Erbil, a Kurdish-held city east of Mosul, for treatment after an apparent chemical-weapon attack.

Many in eastern Mosul lack drinking water, officials have warned, and many in the southern and western parts of the city are drinking untreated water, which could lead to the spread of diseases.

Militia Appears to Seize Control of Route Into Raqqa, Dealing Blow to  ISIS

The Islamic State appeared to suffer an important setback on Monday when American-backed militia fighters in Syria seized the main route that connects Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital, to its territory in southeastern Deir al-Zour Province.

The development essentially severed the last remaining access for supply deliveries to Raqqa and may have eliminated an escape route for Islamic State fighters.

Syrian government forces lost control of Raqqa in 2013 to the opposition, and the Islamic State captured the city later that year. Raqqa was the Islamic State's most important territorial triumph at the time, and the extremist movement regards the city as the center of its self-proclaimed caliphate.

The seizure of the Raqqa exit route on Monday by the American-backed militia, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, was confirmed by a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, and by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. The Syrian Observatory said the militia fighters were just five miles outside the Raqqa city limits.

An assault on Raqqa to expel the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is widely expected in coming weeks, and if successful, it would deliver the organization's biggest defeat in its short and violent history.

The impending assault also represents a test of the complex array of competing forces in Syria fighting the Islamic State -- forces that also could turn on one another.

They include rebel Kurdish and Arab militia members trained and equipped by the United States, Turkish soldiers, the Syrian forces of President Bashar al-Assad and his militia allies supported by Russia and Iran.

Mr. Assad's forces, which recaptured the city of Aleppo from insurgents in December after a prolonged siege, have been rapidly advancing east toward Raqqa in the past few weeks, Reuters reported Monday.

In a sign that the Islamic State is preparing for a possible retreat, male civilians in Raqqa were recently ordered to start dressing similarly to the group's fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory and a second monitoring group known as Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.

By blending into the population, Islamic State fighters not only improve their escape prospects, but make distinguishing civilians from combatants difficult for the American-backed coalition of aerial forces hitting targets around Raqqa.

Activists from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently reported last month that coalition warplanes had destroyed Euphrates River bridge connections into Raqqa. So the Syrian Democratic Forces' seizure of the land route from Raqqa to Deir al-Zour was seen as a major step in isolating the city.

President Trump has said his objective in Syria is to eradicate the Islamic State, but precisely how he intends to accomplish that goal has not been made clear.

The risk of clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces and Turkish soldiers in Syria has increasingly worried American military officials. Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States, regards the Kurdish component of the militias as an enemy aligned with Turkey's Kurdish separatists.

Over the weekend, American military officials said the United States had strengthened its contingent of Syria-based forces to help deter clashes around Manbij, a town in northern Syria near the Turkish border, which Kurdish militia members helped capture from the Islamic State in August.

Turkey has complained that the Kurds have not vacated Manbij as promised.

Fighting in the Syrian civil war, which is about to enter its seventh year, has declined in recent weeks, partly because of a tenuous cease-fire negotiated by Russia and Turkey when Aleppo was retaken by Mr. Assad's forces.

But the prospects for a political settlement remain remote, and the humanitarian crisis has only worsened. Hundreds of thousands have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 as an uprising against Mr. Assad. Roughly five million people have fled the country, and millions more have been displaced.

In a new sign of the toll, Save the Children said in a report issued Monday that the war traumas suffered by Syrian children had increased their long-term risks of suicide, heart disease, diabetes, substance abuse and depression. The report, based on interviews with more than 450 children, adolescents and adults across the country, described a growing child-health crisis that could leave many suffering a condition known as toxic stress.

''The children we spoke with in Syria are terrified to play outside, afraid to go to school, and soiling themselves when they hear a loud noise,'' Carolyn Miles, the president and chief executive of Save the Children, said in releasing the report.

The following is the text of President Trump's executive order on immigration, as released by the White House on Mar. 6, 2017.

EXECUTIVE ORDER

- - - - - - -

PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.

(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).

(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: ''(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.'' 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.

(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: ''Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.'' 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.

(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the ''political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions'' about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.

(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.

(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:

(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.

(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.

(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.

(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.

(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.

(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.

(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.

(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.

(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.

Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.

(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.

(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.

(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.

(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.

(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.

Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension.

(a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:

(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;

(ii) did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and

(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.

(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:

(i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States;

(ii) any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;

(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;

(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;

(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or

(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.

(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:

(i) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;

(ii) the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;

(iii) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;

(iv) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;

(v) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;

(vi) the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;

(vii) the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;

(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or

(ix) the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.

Sec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued,concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.

Sec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.

Sec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.

(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.

(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual's entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.

(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.

Sec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.

Sec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.

Sec. 9. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.

(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.

Sec. 10. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.

Sec. 11. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following information:

(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-security-related reasons;

(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States;

(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called ''honor killings,'' in the United States by foreign nationals; and

(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall release the initial report under subsection (a) of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this order and shall include information for the period from September 11, 2001, until the date of the initial report. Subsequent reports shall be issued every 180 days thereafter and reflect the period since the previous report.

Sec. 12. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with appropriate domestic and international partners, including countries and organizations, to ensure efficient, effective, and appropriate implementation of the actions directed in this order.

(b) In implementing this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, as appropriate, those providing an opportunity for individuals to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determination for aliens covered by section 235(b)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A).

(c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order.

(d) Any individual whose visa was marked revoked or marked canceled as a result of Executive Order 13769 shall be entitled to a travel document confirming that the individual is permitted to travel to the United States and seek entry. Any prior cancellation or revocation of a visa that was solely pursuant to Executive Order 13769 shall not be the basis of inadmissibility for any future determination about entry or admissibility.

(e) This order shall not apply to an individual who has been granted asylum, to a refugee who has already been admitted to the United States, or to an individual granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, consistent with the laws of the United States.

Sec. 13. Revocation. Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017, is revoked as of the effective date of this order.

Sec. 14. Effective Date. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time on March 16, 2017.

Sec. 15. Severability. (a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

(b) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements.

Sec. 16. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

EXECUTIVE ORDER

- - - - - - -

PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.

(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).

(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: “I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.” U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.

(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: “henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries —ach afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States —ould be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities —hoever they are and wherever they reside —o avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.

(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the “olitical branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions”bout who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.

(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government’ willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.

(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State’ Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:

(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa’da and has permitted al-Qa’da to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.

(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States’ounterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.

(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa’da-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.

(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa’da and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan’ support to al-Qa’da has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States’ounterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa’da and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.

(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States’ounterterrorism efforts.

(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa’da in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen’ porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.

(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.

(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government’ capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq’ commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.

(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit’ observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.

Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security’ determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.

(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.

(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.

(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.

(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.

(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.

Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension.

(a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:

(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;

(ii) did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and

(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.

(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:

(i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States;

(ii) any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;

(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;

(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;

(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or

(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.

(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner’ delegee, may, in the consular officer’ or the CBP official’ discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer’ satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:

(i) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;

(ii) the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;

(iii) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;

(iv) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;

(v) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;

(vi) the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;

(vii) the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;

(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or

(ix) the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.

Sec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued,concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.

Sec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.

Sec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.

(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.

(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual’ entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.

(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.

Sec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.

Sec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry‑xit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.

Sec. 9. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.

(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.

Sec. 10. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.

Sec. 11. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following information:

(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-security-related reasons;

(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States;

(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called “onor killings,”n the United States by foreign nationals; and

(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall release the initial report under subsection (a) of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this order and shall include information for the period from September 11, 2001, until the date of the initial report. Subsequent reports shall be issued every 180 days thereafter and reflect the period since the previous report.

(c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order.

(d) Any individual whose visa was marked revoked or marked canceled as a result of Executive Order 13769 shall be entitled to a travel document confirming that the individual is permitted to travel to the United States and seek entry.

WASHINGTON -- It began at 6 p.m. Thursday as a conspiratorial rant on conservative talk radio: President Barack Obama had used the ''instrumentalities of the federal government'' to wiretap the Republican seeking to succeed him. This ''is the big scandal,'' Mark Levin, the host, told his listeners.

By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump's six-week-old presidency.

Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.

To his adversaries, Mr. Trump's bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign's links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia's ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.

But in shifting the story, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia investigation front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. His first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, was last week but now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump's circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.

''I'm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told the audience at a town hall-style meeting in his home state over the weekend. At the same time, he said, ''I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government.''

This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of any such thing, and Mr. Trump's promised investigation has so far led nowhere.

Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama. He spent years promoting the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, promising an investigation to uncover the truth and backing down only last year, during his campaign. And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was ''the founder of ISIS.''

The White House remained firm on Sunday even after Mr. Obama's office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that there had been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump's claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.

''Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,'' Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on ''This Week'' on ABC News. ''There are multiple news outlets that have reported this. And all we're asking is that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they've been claiming that we have done over the last six months.''

Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in ''multiple outlets,'' including The New York Times, as the foundation for the allegation. Mr. Levin, the radio host, likewise read from a series of mainstream news reports during an appearance on ''Fox & Friends'' on Sunday.

''The evidence is overwhelming,'' he said. ''This is not about President Trump's tweeting. This is about the Obama administration's spying, and the question isn't whether it spied.'' He added, ''The question is who they did spy on, the extent of the spying -- that is, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, Trump surrogates.''

But the news organizations he and Ms. Sanders cited have not reported that Mr. Obama tapped Mr. Trump's phones, as the president claimed on Twitter. The Times has reported that several of Mr. Trump's associates are being investigated for their connections with Russians and that law enforcement agencies have examined intercepted communications. It has not reported that those associates themselves have necessarily been wiretapped, but it has reported surveillance of Russians, which is commonplace.

News outlets have noted that a phone call between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, was monitored, leading to Mr. Flynn's resignation because his account of the conversation did not match the intercept. It is common for the United States to monitor the communications of Russia's ambassador.

The Times also reported that before leaving office, Obama officials tried to spread information about Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Russia and Trump associates, in order to leave a trail for government investigators.

Some Republicans suggested that Mr. Trump might have extrapolated that into an unfounded assertion. ''I think the president was not correct, certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower,'' former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said on ''This Week.'' ''However, I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney -- of the Justice Department,'' through the special court that authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States.

Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama's ''tactics'' for a while. But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the specific claims crossed Mr. Trump's desk.

Mr. Trump's aides -- including Mr. Bannon, an anti-establishment figure who has long questioned the motives of parts of the extensive intelligence bureaucracy -- have believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.

They have never offered evidence, but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories. So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article, aides said, they were appealing to him. It was not immediately clear if someone printed the article out for him or if it was part of a collection of Twitter posts and news articles that his aides present to him each day. But it resonated.

Aides say Mr. Trump went into Friday in a foul mood. He had not known ahead of time that Mr. Sessions planned to recuse himself and never thought he should, even after Mr. Sessions acknowledged that he had talked to Mr. Kislyak despite suggesting otherwise in his Senate confirmation hearing.

Mr. Trump told some advisers that he thought Mr. Sessions had fumbled his answer at that hearing. But on Friday morning in an angry session in the Oval Office, the president railed at aides about the recusal, singling out the White House counsel's office and the communications staff in a tirade visible through the window to a nearby television camera.

Still upset after arriving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump woke up Saturday morning and began posting on Twitter at 6:26 a.m. In a burst of six messages, he tried to turn the tables by noting that members of the Obama administration also met with Russia's ambassador. Without citing a source, he asserted that Mr. Obama had tapped his phones, and compared it to Watergate. ''Bad (or sick) guy,'' the president wrote.

While the political world erupted over the allegation, Mr. Trump was adamant in conversations throughout the day that he was on to something. His chief strategist, Mr. Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman, flew down to Florida with Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, on Saturday.

Late Saturday morning, Mr. Trump's aides spoke about how to get him to stop posting on Twitter, to avoid opening himself up to further problems. He golfed a little, then returned to the club and began working the phones. At dinner, he roamed the patio, telling a friend, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, that his claims about Mr. Obama would prove true. By Sunday, advisers said, he was fuming that more people were not defending him.

And so he doubled down, calling for a congressional investigation.

''Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,'' Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Twitter. Until then, he said, the president will not comment further.

Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump’ claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.

“verybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,”arah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on “his Week” on ABC News. “here are multiple news outlets that have reported this. And all we’e asking is that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they’e been claiming that we have done over the last six months.”

Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in “ultiple outlets,”ncluding The New York Times, as the foundation for the allegation. Mr. Levin, the radio host, likewise read from a series of mainstream news reports during an appearance on “ox & Friends”n Sunday.

“he evidence is overwhelming,”e said. “his is not about President Trump’ tweeting. This is about the Obama administration’ spying, and the question isn’ whether it spied.”e added, “he question is who they did spy on, the extent of the spying —hat is, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, Trump surrogates.”

But the news organizations he and Ms. Sanders cited have not reported that Mr. Obama tapped Mr. Trump’ phones, as the president claimed on Twitter. The Times has reported that several of Mr. Trump’ associates are being investigated for their connections with Russians and that law enforcement agencies have examined intercepted communications. It has not reported that those associates themselves have necessarily been wiretapped, but it has reported surveillance of Russians, which is commonplace.

News outlets have noted that a phone call between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’ first national security adviser, and Russia’ ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, was monitored, leading to Mr. Flynn’ resignation because his account of the conversation did not match the intercept. It is common for the United States to monitor the communications of Russia’ ambassador.

The Times also reported that before leaving office, Obama officials tried to spread information about Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Russia and Trump associates, in order to leave a trail for government investigators.

Some Republicans said Mr. Trump might have extrapolated that into an unfounded assertion. “ think the president was not correct, certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower,”ormer Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said on “his Week.”“owever, I think he’ right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney —f the Justice Department, through the FISA court,”hich authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States.

Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama’ “actics”or a while. But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the notion crossed Mr. Trump’ desk. Mr. Trump’ aides have believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.

They have never offered evidence, but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories. So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article, aides said, they were appealing to him. It was not immediately clear if someone printed the article out for him or if it was part of a collection of Twitter posts and news articles that his aides present to him each day. But it resonated.

Aides say Mr. Trump went into Friday in a foul mood. He had not known ahead of time that Mr. Sessions planned to recuse himself and never thought he should have, even after Mr. Sessions acknowledged that he had talked with Mr. Kislyak despite suggesting otherwise in his Senate confirmation hearing.

Mr. Trump told some advisers that he thought Mr. Sessions had fumbled his answer at that hearing. But on Friday morning in an angry session in the Oval Office, the president railed at aides about the recusal, singling out the White House counsel’ office and the communications staff in a tirade visible through the window to a nearby television camera.

Still upset after arriving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump woke up Saturday morning and began tweeting at 6:26 a.m. In a burst of six messages, he tried to turn the tables by noting that members of the Obama administration also met with Russia’ ambassador. Without citing a source, he asserted that Mr. Obama had tapped his phones, and compared it to Watergate. “ad (or sick) guy,”the president tweeted.

While the political world erupted over the allegation, Mr. Trump was adamant in conversations throughout the day that he was on to something. His chief strategist, Mr. Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman, flew down to Florida with Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, on Saturday.

Late Saturday morning, Mr. Trump’ aides spoke about how to get him to stop posting on Twitter, to avoid opening himself up to further problems. He golfed a little, then returned to the club and began working the phones. By Sunday, advisers said, he was fuming that more people were not defending him.

And so he doubled down, calling for a congressional investigation.

“eports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,”r. Trump’ press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Twitter. Until then, he said, the president will not comment further.

CORRECTION APPENDEDWE'LL ALWAYS HAVE CASABLANCA

The Life, Legend, and Afterlife of Hollywood's Most Beloved Movie

By Noah Isenberg

Illustrated. 334 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95.

HIGH NOON

The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic

By Glenn Frankel

Illustrated. 379 pp. Bloomsbury. $28.

It's a strange but serendipitous coincidence that two books devoted to Hollywood classics, ''Casablanca'' and ''High Noon,'' are being published at the same time. The films, released a scant 10 years apart in 1942 and 1952 respectively, are perfect bookends, spot-on reflections of the times in which they were made, and therefore dramatically different. And in the era of the Trump presidency, these books are charged by an immediacy they otherwise might not enjoy.

''Casablanca'' arrived just short of a year after the United States declared war on Germany. In it, Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, whose mantra is ''I stick my neck out for nobody,'' famously does just that, shrugging off the neutrality that had been American policy until Pearl Harbor, and helping his former flame Ingrid Bergman and the Czech resistance hero Paul Henreid escape the Nazis. The film also includes a memorably inspirational episode of collective defiance, as the refugees, con men and adventurers in Rick's place join in a rousing rendition of the ''Marseillaise,'' drowning out German officers who are singing ''Die Wacht am Rhein.''

''High Noon,'' on the other hand, is a profile in collective cowardice. The United States was in the grip of the Red Scare, and the marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper), can't find a single good man in the dusty Western town of Hadleyville to help him confront the Miller brothers and their gang, who have sworn to kill him. Coop prevails, naturally, but his triumph fails to dispel the toxic fog of betrayal and disillusion that shrouds the story.

''We'll Always Have Casablanca'' was written by Noah Isenberg, the director of screen studies at the New School, and probably best known for a biography of Edgar G. Ulmer, a B-film director much beloved by cineastes. Here, Isenberg gives us the soup-to-nuts on ''Casablanca,'' dutifully making his way through script, casting, production and reception, to the inevitable squabbling over credit, all the while trying to account for its enduring popularity.

''Casablanca'' was rooted in a trip that the aspiring playwright Murray Burnett and his wife took to Vienna in the summer of 1938, just after they were married. Austria had overwhelmingly voted to serve itself up to the German Anschluss that March, and was busy implementing the notorious Nuremberg Laws. Burnett quickly discovered that it was not the best place for Jews on their honeymoon. But getting out of Vienna was considerably harder than getting in, especially since Burnett, wearing diamond rings on every finger, and his wife, wearing a fur coat in August, were smuggling out valuables belonging to relatives. When they reached the South of France, they stopped at a cafe full of refugees and army officers. Burnett said to his wife, ''What a setting for a play.''

Burnett developed his play with his writing partner, Joan Alison, but could not get it produced. He did, however, manage to sell it to Warner Brothers, generally known for its progressive pictures, and in particular a series of anti-Nazi films like ''Confessions of a Nazi Spy,'' released in 1939, when other studios were still trying to protect their German assets.

Nobody involved with ''Casablanca'' had high expectations for the picture, although it was written by the colorful Epstein twins, Julius and Philip, and Howard Koch. The Epsteins were widely admired for their witty dialogue, on and off screen. Of the film, Julius once said, ''There wasn't one moment of reality in 'Casablanca.' We weren't making art. We were making a living.'' Nevertheless, when it was released, it became an instant hit, and won three Oscars, including best picture. It's all in Isenberg's account, and ''Casablanca'' fans will find it to be a treasure trove of facts and anecdotes.

''High Noon'' is a far deeper dig into the background and historical context of its subject; that is, the sorry history of the blacklist, instituted by the studios after the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) put a gun to their collective heads in 1947.

Despite the voluminous literature on the subject, surprisingly little has been written about ''High Noon.'' For many years, Billy Wilder's unfriendly words about the so-called Unfriendly Ten who refused to answer questions before HUAC -- ''Only two of them have talent. The rest are just unfriendly'' -- passed for the conventional wisdom. Even though Carl Foreman, who hatched the story and wrote the script, had more -- and better -- credits than most of his blacklisted confreres, unlike them he didn't live to finish writing his memoirs. The director, Fred Zinnemann, never made it into the film critic Andrew Sarris's famous Pantheon, and the producer, Stanley Kramer, was condescended to by intellectuals for his message movies.

Glenn Frankel comes to his subject with a widely praised book about John Ford's ''The Searchers'' and an impressive réumén journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize. Although much of Frankel's material is familiar, the blacklist is a gift that keeps on giving. There always seems to be something new to chew on, in this case the transcripts of HUAC's secret executive sessions. Besides, it's a story that bears retelling because Hollywood, not to mention the rest of the country, is haunted by ghosts that won't go away (witness Newt Gingrich's recent call for a resurrection of HUAC, now to be wielded against ISIS, not Communists).

At first HUAC was considered something of a joke, but as time passed, the committee's antics became more scary than risible. Like much of the Hollywood left, Humphrey Bogart supported the 19 ''unfriendly'' screenwriters initially called before the committee. He had backed Franklin Roosevelt in his 1944 presidential campaign, and when he was attacked by the right, he struck a defiant note in The Saturday Evening Post. Alluding to his role in ''Casablanca,'' he wrote, ''I'm going to keep right on sticking my neck out, without worrying about its possible effect upon my career.'' But a brief three years later, when the right turned up the heat, he published an abject apologia in Photoplay magazine entitled, ''I'm No Communist,'' in which he distanced himself from the Ten. Likewise, Jack Warner, whose studio had invented the anti-fascist genre, gave HUAC the names of 16 screenwriters, including those of the Epstein twins, of whom he said, ''Those boys are always on the side of the underdog.'' Foreman didn't intend his script to be the blacklist parable it became, but as he watched his friends fall around him, it was almost inevitable. Foreman felt like the Gary Cooper character. He regarded ''High Noon'' as a picture about ''conscience'' versus ''compromise.''

Surprisingly, it is Gary Cooper, a card-carrying conservative, who emerges as one of the few heroes of this story. Called before HUAC in the middle of production, Foreman gave his star the opportunity to leave the picture -- guilt by association was de rigueur in those days -- but Cooper refused. Foreman declined to name names, and Kramer fired him. In ''Casablanca,'' the so-called refugee trail led from Europe to America. During the witch hunt years, it went the other way. Moving to London, Foreman said goodbye to his country, his livelihood and, eventually, his marriage. Cooper tried to help him by buying stock in his new company, but bullied by the likes of John Wayne and Hedda Hopper, he eventually pulled out, albeit cordially. If Foreman had thought that art was imitating life in ''High Noon,'' once Cooper caved it seemed clear that at least in his life, unlike Marshal Will Kane's, there were no happy endings.

Frankel narrates this story well. He has a sure ear for the telling anecdote, and a good eye for detail. (Parnell Thomas chaired the HUAC hearings sitting on a phone book covered by a red cushion to compensate for his diminutive stature.) The era has been labeled ''the plague years,'' but Frankel is forgiving of those caught up in its tangle of principle and expediency, courage and cowardice. He adopts the verdict of Dalton Trumbo, another of the Unfriendly Ten: ''There were only victims.''

Correction: March 19, 2017, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on March 5 about Noah Isenberg's ''We'll Always Have Casablanca'' and Glenn Frankel's ''High Noon'' misstated the constitutional amendment under which the so-called Unfriendly Ten refused to answer questions before the House Un-American Activities Committee during its investigation of the Hollywood film industry in 1947. The 10 maintained that they were entitled to remain silent under the terms of the First Amendment, not the Fifth. (Their interpretation of the First Amendment was rejected in court, and they were cited for contempt of Congress.

A Conspiracy Theory’ Journey From Talk Radio to Trump’ Twitter

WASHINGTON —t began at 6 p.m. Thursday as a conspiratorial rant on conservative talk radio: President Barack Obama had used the “nstrumentalities of the federal government”o wiretap the Republican seeking to succeed him. This “s the big scandal,”ark Levin, the host, told his listeners.

By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump’ chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump’ six-week-old presidency.

Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.

To his adversaries, Mr. Trump’ bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign’ links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia’ ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.

But in shifting the story, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia investigation front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. His first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, was last week but now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump’ circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.

“’ very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally,”enator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told the audience at a town hall-style meeting in his home state over the weekend. At the same time, he said, “ would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government.”

This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of any such thing, and Mr. Trump’ promised investigation has so far led nowhere.

Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama. He spent years promoting the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, promising an investigation to uncover the truth and backing down only last year, during his campaign. And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was “he founder of ISIS.”

The White House remained firm on Sunday even after Mr. Obama’ office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, said on NBC’ “eet the Press”hat there had been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump’ claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.

“verybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,”arah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on “his Week” on ABC News. “here are multiple news outlets that have reported this. And all we’e asking is that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they’e been claiming that we have done over the last six months.”

Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in “ultiple outlets,”ncluding The New York Times, as the foundation for the allegation. Mr. Levin, the radio host, likewise read from a series of mainstream news reports during an appearance on “ox & Friends”n Sunday.

Mukasey said on “his Week.”“owever, I think he’ right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney —f the Justice Department,”hrough the special court that authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States.

Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama’ “actics”or a while. But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the specific claims crossed Mr. Trump’ desk.

Mr. Trump’ aides —ncluding Mr. Bannon, an anti-establishment figure who has long questioned the motives of parts of the extensive intelligence bureaucracy —ave believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.

They have never offered evidence, but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories. So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article, aides said, they were appealing to him.

He golfed a little, then returned to the club and began working the phones. At dinner, he roamed the patio, telling a friend, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, that his claims about Mr. Obama would prove true. By Sunday, advisers said, he was fuming that more people were not defending him.

And so he doubled down, calling for a congressional investigation.

“eports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,”r. Trump’ press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Twitter. Until then, he said, the president will not comment further.

Long Island Man Is Charged With Trying to Join  ISIS

A Long Island man was ordered held without bail on Saturday after federal authorities accused him of twice traveling to the Middle East in recent years in an effort to ''wage violent jihad'' alongside terrorist groups.

The man, Elvis Redzepagic, was arrested on Friday at his home in Commack, N.Y., on charges of attempting to provide material support and resources to terrorists, federal officials said.

Mr. Redzepagic, 26, is accused of trying to join the Islamic State or the Nusra Front in 2015 and 2016, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Saturday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.

''This defendant made numerous attempts to travel to Syria to wage violent jihad,'' Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. ''We will continue to track down and prosecute individuals like the defendant before they are able to become foreign fighters or harm the United States and its allies.''

According to the complaint, Mr. Redzepagic first spoke to federal agents after being arrested in Suffolk County in February for an unrelated offense. In interviews with investigators from a joint terrorism task force, he said he had become a Muslim while he was in Montenegro.

In 2015, the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic began communicating with a cousin who he believed was a member of the Islamic State or the Nusra Front and the commander of a battalion in Syria.

Mr. Redzepagic told the authorities that the cousin, who was not identified, instructed him to travel to Istanbul and contact him when he got there, according to the complaint.

Based on Mr. Redzepagic's account and airline and customs records, the complaint said, the authorities determined that he had indeed traveled to Turkey that year, spending about seven days in Istanbul and making ''several unsuccessful attempts to obtain help and cross the border into Syria.''

The complaint said Mr. Redzepagic told the authorities ''he was prepared to strap a bomb on and sacrifice himself for jihad.''

He also told investigators he believed that fighting in Syria was different from committing a domestic act of terrorism and that he did not want to harm innocent people, the complaint said.

Unable to reach his cousin and ''frustrated by the lack of assistance he was receiving, and unable to enter Syria,'' the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic returned to the United States.

During interviews with the terrorism task force, Mr. Redzepagic expressed admiration for Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and propagandist for Al Qaeda who was killed in a drone strike conducted by the United States in 2011.

After obtaining a search warrant, investigators searched a Facebook account used by Mr. Redzepagic where they found messages he had sent, including ''I read a lot about jihad,'' and ''since I got back from turkey from trying to perform Jihad and join Jabhat Al Nusra the cia has been bothering me,'' according to the complaint.

In August 2016, the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic went to Jordan planning to enter Syria. But he was stopped by Jordanian officials and returned to the United States. Mr. Redzepagic told Customs and Border Protection officials who debriefed him when he returned that the purpose of his trip was to learn Arabic.

Mildred M. Whalen, a lawyer for Mr. Redzepagic, said in an email that he had been ''fully cooperative with law enforcement.''

''We will be working with his family in the hope that the court and the government will see that what he needs is counseling and support, not imprisonment,'' Ms. Whalen said.

''At the right time,'' President Trump said during his campaign for president, ''I will be so presidential, you will be so bored.'' That time appeared to come Tuesday, when the president -- in his first address to Congress -- ''reached for poetry,'' ''adopted a statesmanlike cadence'' and laid forth, through a tribute to a slain American soldier, ''one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics,'' causing the Dow Jones industrial average to soar. It wasn't boring, per se, but pundits appeared to think it was ''presidential.'' Does being president automatically make one presidential, as Kellyanne Conway once claimed about the president-elect? Not quite. In an effort to echolocate a very low (The lowest! Failing! Sad!) bar, a quick look at ''presidential'' behavior, then and now:

The old bar: Read speech from teleprompter before members of Congress without ad-libbing.

The new, Trumpian bar: Read speech from teleprompter before members of Congress without ad-libbing repeatedly about the flaws of the opposing candidate you beat nearly four months ago.

The old bar: Inspire viewers with oratorical flair.

The new bar: Prove capable of speaking for 60 minutes without throwing a temper tantrum and ranting about ratings, the failing New York Times, fake news or the size of your inaugural crowd. Bonus points: Refrain, for eight days, from tweeting in ALL CAPS.

The old bar: Promptly condemn bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers.

The new bar: Refrain, for 60 minutes, from suggesting people may be threatening to bomb their own J.C.C.s.

The old bar: Invite special guests to sit with the first family as a way to draw attention to issues of social justice.

The new bar: Track down the tiny percentage of Americans whose family members were killed by undocumented immigrants and parade them as poster children for the evils of immigration, despite study after study showing that immigrants actually commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.

The old bar: Pay tribute to service members killed in the line of duty.

The new bar: Refrain from insulting family of service member killed in the line of duty, then humblebrag that late service member must be smiling down from heaven proudly because of the length of applause.

The old bar: Detail plan to demolish and destroy the Islamic State and combat terrorism.

The new bar: Proudly announce that you have directed the Department of Defense to ''develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS,'' as if that had never occurred to anyone before. Bonus points: Refrain from alluding to a terror attack that never happened.

The old bar: Weave in issues of racial equality and justice.

The new bar: Give a speech that is praised by the former K.K.K. grand wizard David Duke, but finally button your suit jacket.

The old bar: Nominate judges to Supreme Court whose interpretations of the Constitution you believe will strengthen democracy.

The new bar: Pat self on back for choosing a nominee who will ''defend our Constitution,'' which is his job description.

The old bar: Focus on big-tent items like national security, poverty and the economy.

The new bar: Declare that ''time for small thinking is over'' and ''trivial fights'' are ''behind us'' mere weeks after calling Meryl Streep ''overrated'' and unleashing a Twitter war with Arnold Schwarzenegger over the ratings for ''The Celebrity Apprentice.''

The old bar: Be a man who leads and inspires the free world.

The new bar: Be a man who, at age 70, reads a speech written by committee without stuttering or sniffing, and remains vertical for 60 minutes. Basically, be as good at playing the role of ''president'' as your average Florida dinner theater actor.

The old bar: Start national conversation about the direction of our country.

The new bar: Barely make it 24 hours into a news cycle before news of a speech is overtaken by the latest revelations of a cabinet member's communications with the Russians during your presidential campaign.

PARIS -- The general tone of current public discourse -- the name-calling, the taunts, the accusations -- is bringing Rick Owens down. Know what he's talking about?

So on the day Marine Le Pen, the far-right French presidential candidate, lost her immunity to prosecution for posting photographs on Twitter of violent ISIS killings, he offered up an antidote to his own malaise.

''Maybe embracing what makes us civilized can be our most positive act,'' Mr. Owens wrote in a sort of statement of intent before his fall show. ''Ceremonies are about groups agreeing on codes of behavior and collectively committing to them. I've always thought of shows as contemporary ceremonies.''

Certainly they have their own pomp and protocol. Though the codes of this particular form of shared behavior seem largely limited to filing in and out of assorted venues obediently and agreeing to be penned on crammed benches multiple times a day without food or water.

But go with the idea for the moment.

Because it casts the clothes, then, as reminders of our best selves; vestiges and expressions of that civilization. Or, as Mr. Owens designed them this time around, perhaps reminders of the selves we might be if we were part of a newfangled priesthood tending to the altars of the essential shared fabric(s) of life.

He crowned his women with miters made from sweatshirt sleeves draped over the face, like an elephant trunk, and wrapped them in coats united from wool and duvet covers; he whorled felted wool into rosettes at the waist and hip, and left sleeves flowing to the knees like a train.

He stretched T-shirts into cardinal's hats and patched leather and canvas into processional robes, sometimes with giant flying buttresses jutting from the side. He took the materials of the street and elevated them.

The result looked weird (with Mr. Owens, it often does), but the Mr. Snuffleupagus headgear made everyone smile, and the point was compelling: Rise to the occasion, don't sink to it. And at the very least, dress for it. Isn't that what your grandmother always told you? It's the fashion equivalent of cognitive studies that suggest smiling more makes you feel better; both posit that what you do, or don, on the outside, can help change your inside.

And Mr. Owens wasn't the only one with the gentling power of ritual on his mind. In a lovely Ann Demeulemeester show, Séastien Meunier used lacy wimples-cum-veils to frame a notably more romantic collection that built on the shipwrecked tailoring of the brand's founder and brought it forward: into billowing silk dresses in dusky rose; slouchy crushed velvet; and sweeping leather greatcoats. Decoration came via fur and even feathers at the neck (there were still some dangling strings, but not too many). When leather leggings become a grace note, something interesting is going on.

There's been a lot of battle dress on the women's runways, for obvious reasons -- perhaps too obvious. Also a lot of escapism (again: duh).

Now, halfway through Paris, there's a third way: turning the other cheek. It looks pretty good. Depending on what direction you are facing, of course.

At Paco Rabanne, Julien Dossena fetishized dance, alongside the brand's trademark futurism and his own tetchy sportswear, a tripartite approach that added a refined fluidity to his arsenal. Ribbed knits and silver chain mail were cut asymmetrically on the bias in tops and skirts, sometimes paired with leotard-like stretch jersey, all of it grounded by crisp white shirting and tailored trousers.

But at Loewe, Jonathan Anderson transformed the concrete interior of the Unesco headquarters into a series of pitch-black steamy caverns to create a ''controlled environment,'' the better to spotlight the exoticism of 60 different sorts of orchids. Also photographs from the 1930s by Lionel Wendt, mostly of young men in India. Then off he went on a sartorial journey that ranged -- well, all over the map, from farmland to Sunset Boulevard. Imagine plowing the furrows of film noir and you'll get the idea.

Airy peasant smocking and elongated shifts made from silk patchwork squares paraded next to fan-pleated silver lamé Tartan was needle-punched into polka dots; logo Fair Isle-ish knits followed billowing Cossack trousers and elegant tailored overcoats in silk and leather. Some of it was good (those coats; a black silk dress with micro-pleating) and some of it was confused, but mostly it just made you wonder: Where is he going with all this? On too many trajectories at once.

Not, however, the one Olivier Rousteing chose at Balmain, which led straight to the wild kingdom by way of Caesars Palace and could be summed up, in an entirely literal way, as: ''I am woman, hear me roar.'' Despite the fact that the reference the designer name-checked in his show notes was Nirvana.

Mr. Rousteing was thinking of the music, not the clothes, presumably, because grunge wasn't really in sight, save for some tie-dye in Serengeti shades. Instead we got -- well, pretty much every animal in ''The Lion King'' and then some: tigers, zebras, wolves, eagles, mustangs and pythons. Plus thigh-high suede stiletto boots. Kendall Jenner looked as if she was wearing an entire alligator on her back, with another on her front.

And because that wasn't enough, also fringe and crystal and studs all semaphored together to create a mythical Vegas-in-the-veld creature made of glitz and grrr. It was hard not to giggle, although that was probably not the intended reaction.

For vegans, there were some ''queen of the jungle'' shaggy knits.

That's outreach, of a sort, even if the message was less about civil society than hashtag society and big-game hunting (we appear to have moved on from #Balmainia to #Balmenagerie). Though whether the trophies were supposed to be the pelts or the women who wore them was never entirely clear.

President Trump's first address to Congress checked nearly all the domestic policy boxes that dominated his public statements during the campaign and his few short weeks in the White House -- jobs, immigration, taxes, medical care. But there was one gaping omission: foreign policy. Here was his moment to assert understanding of the foreign policy threats and opportunities facing the country, and his vision of his role as commander in chief with a wider understanding of America's role in the world. He failed to grasp it.

He boasted about plans to throw billions more dollars at the Pentagon, without a word about how this will advance national security. He spoke at length about his plans to bar and expel immigrants he regards as dangerous, but far less about the very real threats from the Islamic State and other extremist groups. There was no coherent idea about major continuing challenges in Afghanistan and Syria. In fact, the words Afghanistan and Syria -- as well as North Korea (with its growing nuclear arsenal) -- never crossed his lips. China and Iran got passing mention; climate change -- a major global challenge -- zero.

So how did he deploy his energies and display his concern? Chiefly by recognizing the widow of Senior Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the Navy SEALs who was killed in January in a botched raid in Yemen, which Mr. Trump blamed on ''the generals.''

Thus ensued several agonizing minutes as Carryn Owens struggled gamely to keep her composure while the audience gave her a standing ovation to which Mr. Trump added a grotesque coda, announcing that Chief Owens would be ''very happy because I think he just broke a record'' by drawing sustained applause.

None of this could erase the fact that Chief Owens's father had earlier demanded an investigation into what he called a ''stupid mission'' and refused to meet Mr. Trump. Or that Mr. Trump, asked about Mr. Owens's criticism on ''Fox & Friends,'' refused to accept responsibility, as most commanders in chief would do, and instead blamed the military commanders for the operation.

Alarmingly, Mr. Trump appears to have no plans or strategy in parts of the world where American troops are actively engaged. In Afghanistan, where the United States has been at war for 15 years, 8,400 American troops are now on active duty, and officers there are asking for a few thousand more. American forces are playing a crucial role in helping Iraqi troops recapture Mosul from ISIS and are assisting Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria to retake Raqqa, capital of ISIS' self-declared caliphate. Mr. Trump said he had asked for a plan ''to demolish and destroy'' ISIS, and on Monday the Pentagon presented him with new options, including deploying a few hundred more troops in both countries.

If Mr. Trump has ideas about how to deal with an increasingly aggressive Russia, which the Pentagon considers America's No. 1 threat, or China, which has become more assertive in the South China Sea, he did not divulge them. One plausible possibility is that Mr. Trump's murky ties to Russia, which intelligence agencies say hacked the Democrats in an effort to skew the election on his behalf, has crippled his ability to even talk about Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its destabilizing behavior in Ukraine, Syria and Europe.

It was thus a momentary relief when Mr. Trump said, ''We strongly support NATO,'' backing off his earlier ambivalence toward the alliance. But he then trivialized the moment by insisting that his push for the allies to increase military spending had produced instant results and ''the money is pouring in.'' (That isn't the way NATO operates, and there isn't any money pouring in anywhere.)

Presidential speeches are not as a rule detailed action plans, but a chance to illuminate priorities. On foreign policy, Mr. Trump has been hampered by his inexperience, narrow, protectionist impulses, and an erratic managing style that has made it hard to attract a capable staff. He has kept the focus on domestic issues, where he and his supporters seem more comfortable. As to America's role in the world and its multiple challenges, he seems clueless and, at best, insecure.

A Family Finds Iraqi Troops, and a Reprieve From  ISIS

From a ridge overlooking a village in western Mosul, the Iraqi troops spotted the family fleeing the Islamic State. Through their binoculars, the soldiers saw that the small group approaching us was waving a white flag, and so they held their fire.

The family included three women -- one of them pregnant -- two men, several children and a dog.

The soldiers, with whom I was embedded this week, walked down the trail to intercept the group on the flank of a hill exposed to the Islamic State's mortar rounds. I saw them help up the grandmother in the family, who was lagging behind.

She reached the top of the ridge, clutching her heart and saying, ''Alhamdulillah,'' meaning ''Thank you, God.''

The grandmother's name is Khadija Abbas. At the top of the ridge, she crumpled to the ground and held her open palms up to the sky. She took off her tattered plastic shoes and showed me that they were held together with string.

Ms. Abbas explained that at least 10 families related in some way to her were trapped in the village. They had sent her delegation ahead to see if it was safe to leave.

Iraqi intelligence agents were there to meet the family and to try to determine if they were civilians or militants. The officers had a list of people suspected of being members of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and they immediately checked the family's identification cards against their list.

The Iraqi soldiers in our group, which also included a small unit of American advisers, gave one of the family members a cigarette, as the militants took over the area and forbade smoking nearly three years ago.

The pregnant woman began to feel faint. The New York Times team's medic ran to the car and came back with an IV drip to help with dehydration. She lay in a ditch as her husband stood above her, holding the bag of fluid.

As members of the family were catching their breath, a ripple of panic suddenly spread through the group: The troops spotted several cars speeding toward us and began firing warning shots.

The pregnant woman, who was still hooked up to the drip, and the grandmother, Ms. Abbas, began screaming that the people coming up the hill were their relatives. The Iraqi Army has suffered numerous casualties from car bombs detonated by Islamic State militants, and the soldiers were visibly on edge.

Ms. Abbas pleaded with the troops, saying their relatives were in three white cars, two silver ones and a blue one. The Iraqi troops, using binoculars for a better view, confirmed her account and stopped firing.

No one was injured. Even the family's dog -- which had scampered away when the gunfire erupted -- was safe. ''Everyone is fleeing ISIS, even the animals,'' one of the villagers joked, when I asked why they had brought the dog with them.

The family showed us the square of cloth they had used as a white flag to signal to the troops that they were civilians. In the barren desert surrounding their village, they said, they had been unable to find a stick to put it on.

By the end of the afternoon, more than 30 civilians had made it to the hill. When the terrorist group began lobbing mortar rounds in their direction, the Iraqi troops asked the families to move.

Hours later, we saw a plume of smoke coming from car bombs in the area that the civilians had fled. By the end of the day, Iraqi forces declared it liberated.

We headed back to our base in a secure part of western Mosul. On the way, we passed one of the cars carrying Ms. Abbas's family, her relatives flashing ''V'' signs for victory.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Russia Bombs Syrian Allies of the U.S. by Mistake

WASHINGTON -- Russian aircraft mistakenly bombed Syrian Arab fighters who were being trained by the United States, the commander of the American-led operation in Iraq and Syria said Wednesday. American advisers were about three miles away when the Russian strike occurred.

The episode pointed to the risk of unintended clashes among the myriad forces operating on a fluid battlefield in Syria, as the American command looks toward the fight to retake Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital in the country.

Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the American-led task force that is fighting the militants in Iraq and Syria, said the strike by Russian and Syrian government planes led to casualties among the Syrian fighters, but he declined to say how many were hurt or if any were killed.

He added that the Russian attack appeared to have been a mistake: The Russian military thought it was bombing villages held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, when in fact they were recently occupied by Syrian Arab fighters.

''We had some Russian aircraft and regime aircraft bomb some villages that I believe they thought were held by ISIS,'' General Townsend said in a video news conference with reporters at the Pentagon. ''Actually on the ground were some of our Syrian Arab coalition forces.''

A spokesman for the American-led command in Baghdad said that the Russian airstrikes took place about 10 miles southwest of Manbij. The Russian bombing stopped after American military officers at the air war command in Qatar called their Russian counterparts in Syria.

In Moscow, the Defense Ministry asserted that the United States had provided the coordinates of American-backed forces in northern Syria before the airstrikes and that Russian and Syria warplanes had not struck any areas that had been properly designated.

''No airstrikes were carried out by either Syrian or Russian aircraft in areas designated by the U.S.,'' the ministry said in a statement.

The battlefield in northern Syria is crowded with a diverse array of forces near Al Bab, including Turkish-backed Syrian militias, Syrian government forces, Kurdish and Arab fighters backed by the United States, and ISIS militants.

''Around Al Bab, all the forces that are acting in Syria have converged literally within hand-grenade range of one another,'' General Townsend said.

There has been a similar convergence of forces to the east where Syrian government forces have advanced to the point where they are within ''rifle range'' of Syrian Arab fighters backed by the United States who are defending the area around Manbij, the general added.

''It's very difficult and complicated,'' he said.

General Townsend said the United States was encouraging all sides to focus on the fight against the Islamic State and not let tensions among groups divert them from the need to take Raqqa.

''That's what we ought to keep our efforts focused on and not fighting deliberately or accidentally with one another,'' he said.

This is the second time in recent weeks that there has been an episode of so-called friendly fire involving the Russians. Last month, Russian fighters mistakenly bombed Turkish soldiers near Al Bab.

The Russian airstrikes also raise the question of whether the American military needs to broaden its dialogue with Russian commanders over operations in Syria. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met last month in Azerbaijan with Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff. It was their first meeting and the discussion included how to ''enhance communications,'' the Pentagon said.

Discussing the fighting in Iraq, General Townsend also said that some low-level Islamic State fighters had sought to escape from Mosul disguised as civilians, but that they had been detained.

He said that there were 12,000 to 15,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, some 2,000 of them in western Mosul and in and around the nearby town of Tal Afar.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has presented the White House with his recommendations on how to step up the military campaign against ISIS, which President Trump vowed to ''demolish and destroy'' in his address to Congress on Tuesday.

General Townsend suggested that he did not foresee the United States ''bringing in large numbers of coalition troops'' to help with Iraq and the assault on Raqqa.

Are Immigrants Causing a Swedish Crime Wave?

Sweden has accepted more refugees on a per-capita basis than other Western nations in recent years. President Trump and his supporters say that this has led to increased crime and other problems in that country and argue that this is a reason the United States should accept fewer immigrants, especially those coming from the Middle East. Official data show that Sweden has not seen a spike in crime, though the influx has heightened anti-immigrant sentiment there.

 To better understand that country’ experience, I spoke to Henrik Emilsson, an international immigration researcher at Malmöniversity. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What has been happening in Sweden in recent years with regard to immigration?

Sweden has always had more humanitarian migrants than the rest of Europe. For the last 10 years it has been seven or eight times the average in Europe. Since 2006, it has been a very high number of asylum seekers —irst the Iraqis, then Somalis and Afghanis, and now, the latest wave from Syria.

Is there any evidence that recent immigrants are having an impact on crime in Sweden?

Not the recent ones. There is a huge debate in Sweden about immigration and crime. And we know from earlier statistics that the foreign-born commit three times as many crimes on average as native-borns. But these riots and crimes in the suburbs, they are related mostly to drugs and gangs. Those people are born and raised in Sweden. It has nothing to do with the recent immigration. It’ the children of migrants and maybe people that came when they were young.

There has been this issue of sexual harassment. And there is some evidence that the new refugees are somewhat involved in this. But there are no official statistics on it.

What about terrorism?

Not particularly, because the people for example who have gone and fought for ISIS, they are also quite established —hey are Swedes that have grown up here.

Why would people who have been in Sweden for a while, or their children, become radicalized? Does it have anything to do with the circumstances in which they grew up?

There is no evidence that this has anything to do with poverty or segregation or social exclusion. Some of them are highly educated while others are less educated. Some have good careers and some have studied at the university. It’ not easy to explain, there are no clear patterns. And some have parents who are not religious, but others have parents who are religious.

Have recent immigrants done more poorly in Sweden than people who came in previous decades?

It depends on how far back you look. For example in the civil war in Yugoslavia in the early 90s, it was a catastrophe when they arrived. There was the same panic. It took a long time for them to find jobs. But if you look at that group now, they are very successful. They have like 70 percent employment rate.

We don’ have these low-skilled jobs, so it takes a lot of training and education, and patience. Since 2006, the migrants have been more from failed states like Afghanistan and Somalia and Iraq, so they probably will have a more difficult situation. So in the short term it will be a big cost for society. In the long term maybe if they end up doing as well as Bosnians, it will be an asset.

Do you think that maybe the Bosnian —r, broadly speaking, the Yugoslav —xperience is different because they are also European?

It’ mostly that often they were professionals. They didn’ necessarily have very high education, but they were specialists in different crafts. But they were mostly also Muslim, so it has less to do with religion, I think.

How would you rate Swedish policies toward integrating migrants, especially those who’e come in the last five or ten years?

I think we have done a better job than most European countries. It’ just that we have taken in so many more that it is a bigger challenge. I mean if you compare the unemployment rate for refugees in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, Sweden is the most successful. Also if you compare the same category of migrants in Canada and Sweden, they do just as well in Sweden as in Canada.

It was thus a momentary relief when Mr. Trump said, “e strongly support NATO,”acking off his earlier ambivalence toward the alliance. But he then trivialized the moment by insisting that his push for the allies to increase military spending had produced instant results and “he money is pouring in.”That isn’ the way NATO operates, and there isn’ any money pouring in anywhere.)

Presidential speeches are not as a rule detailed action plans, but a chance to illuminate priorities. On foreign policy, Mr. Trump has been hampered by his inexperience, narrow, protectionist impulses, and an erratic managing style that has made it hard to attract a capable staff. He has kept the focus on domestic issues, where he and his supporters seem more comfortable. As to America’ role in the world and its multiple challenges, he seems clueless and, at best, insecure.

President Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service.

For more coverage, read our live analysis.

TRUMP: Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States ...

(APPLAUSE)

... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.

Recent threats ...

(APPLAUSE)

Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.

(APPLAUSE)

Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.

I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...

(APPLAUSE)

... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.

(APPLAUSE)

All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.

But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.

For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.

We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.

But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.

Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.

Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler , General Motors , Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed , Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

(APPLAUSE)

The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.

We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.

We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials -- and a lifetime ban ...

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...

(APPLAUSE)

... and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.]

(APPLAUSE)

We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...

(APPLAUSE)

... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.

(APPLAUSE)

We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

(APPLAUSE)

And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.

(APPLAUSE)

To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they don't do much.]

(APPLAUSE)

We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

(APPLAUSE)

At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

(APPLAUSE)

By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.

(APPLAUSE)

We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.

We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.

(APPLAUSE)

For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.

(APPLAUSE)

As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?

(APPLAUSE)

Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.

(APPLAUSE)

According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.

It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.

(APPLAUSE)

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.

(APPLAUSE)

As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.

(APPLAUSE)

I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.

(APPLAUSE)

Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court , from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.

(APPLAUSE)

I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.

To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.

(APPLAUSE)

Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True -- but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]

More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.

We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.

Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.

(APPLAUSE)

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

(APPLAUSE)

It will be a big, big cut.

At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers -- have to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson . In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, ''No, thank you.''

(LAUGHTER)

At our meeting, I asked them, ''How are you doing? How is business?'' They said that it's good. I asked them further, ''How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?''

They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.

They weren't even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...

(APPLAUSE)

I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade.

The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that ''the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.''

Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.

(APPLAUSE)

I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken -- advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.

(APPLAUSE)

I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.

(APPLAUSE)

The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.

(APPLAUSE)

It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.

According to the National Academy of Sciences , our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.

(APPLAUSE)

I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.

If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

(APPLAUSE)

Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.

(APPLAUSE)

America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.

(APPLAUSE)

To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.

(APPLAUSE)

This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.

(APPLAUSE)

Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...

(APPLAUSE)

... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.

(APPLAUSE)

Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.

(APPLAUSE)

The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.

(APPLAUSE)

Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. [Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.

One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They're leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There's no choice left.

Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.

(APPLAUSE)

Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.

(APPLAUSE)

Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.

First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.

(APPLAUSE)

Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.

(APPLAUSE)

Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.

(APPLAUSE)

Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.

(APPLAUSE)

And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...

(APPLAUSE)

... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.

Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?

(APPLAUSE)

On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...

(APPLAUSE)

... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.

(APPLAUSE)

True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.

An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...

(APPLAUSE)

Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.

(APPLAUSE)

Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.

If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.

(APPLAUSE)

In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind -- and the souls -- of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.

(APPLAUSE)

I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.

(APPLAUSE)

These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.

(APPLAUSE)

Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

(APPLAUSE)

But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.

(APPLAUSE)

Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.

(APPLAUSE)

But to create this future, we must work with -- not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement.

(APPLAUSE)

We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's -- really, it's what it is, division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.

(APPLAUSE)

And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.

We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us ...

(APPLAUSE)

Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.

But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands -- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis -- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.

Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.

(APPLAUSE)

To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.

(APPLAUSE)

Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win.

(APPLAUSE)

I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...

(APPLAUSE)

... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.

(APPLAUSE)

The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.

(APPLAUSE)

We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William ''Ryan'' Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.

(APPLAUSE)

I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ''Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.''

Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.

(APPLAUSE)

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.

(APPLAUSE)

To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.

We strongly support NATO , an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...

(APPLAUSE)

... and a Cold War and defeated communism.

(APPLAUSE)

But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.

(APPLAUSE)

We expect our partners, whether in NATO , in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost -- have to do that.

We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.

(APPLAUSE)

Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.

The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.

(APPLAUSE)

America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.

On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.

(APPLAUSE)

Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.

(APPLAUSE)

When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.

We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.

(APPLAUSE)

When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.

From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.

I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.

Now, About That Role as Commander in Chief ...; Editorial

By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

President Trump’ first address to Congress checked nearly all the domestic policy boxes that dominated his public statements during the campaign and his few short weeks in the White House —obs, immigration, taxes, medical care. But there was one gaping omission: foreign policy. Here was his moment to assert understanding of the foreign policy threats and opportunities facing the country, and his vision of his role as commander in chief with a wider understanding of America’ role in the world. He failed to grasp it.

He boasted about plans to throw billions more dollars at the Pentagon, without a word about how this will advance national security. He spoke at length about his plans to bar and expel immigrants he regards as dangerous, but far less about the very real threats from the Islamic State and other extremist groups. There was no coherent idea about major continuing challenges in Afghanistan and Syria. In fact, the words Afghanistan and Syria —s well as North Korea (with its growing nuclear arsenal) —ever crossed his lips. China and Iran got passing mention; climate change — major global challenge —ero.

So how did he deploy his energies and display his concern? Chiefly by recognizing the widow of Senior Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the Navy SEALs who was killed in January in a botched raid in Yemen, which Mr. Trump blamed on “he generals.”

Thus ensued several agonizing minutes as Carryn Owens struggled gamely to keep her composure while the audience gave her a standing ovation to which Mr. Trump added a grotesque coda, announcing that Chief Owens would be “ery happy because I think he just broke a record”y drawing sustained applause.

None of this could erase the fact that Chief Owens’ father had earlier demanded an investigation into what he called a “tupid mission” and refused to meet Mr. Trump. Or that Mr. Trump, asked about Mr. Owens’ criticism on “ox & Friends,”efused to accept responsibility, as most commanders in chief would do, and instead blamed the military commanders for the operation.

Alarmingly, Mr. Trump appears to have no plans or strategy in parts of the world where American troops are actively engaged. In Afghanistan, where the United States has been at war for 15 years, 8,400 American troops are now on active duty, and officers there  are asking for a few thousand more. American forces are playing a crucial role in helping Iraqi troops recapture Mosul from ISIS and are assisting Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria to retake Raqqa, capital of ISIS’elf-declared caliphate. Mr. Trump said he had asked for a plan “o demolish and destroy”ISIS, and on Monday the Pentagon presented him with new options, including deploying a few hundred more troops in both countries.

If Mr. Trump has ideas about how to deal with an increasingly aggressive Russia, which the Pentagon considers America’ No. 1 threat, or China, which has become more assertive in the South China Sea, he did not divulge them. One plausible possibility is that Mr. Trump’ murky ties to Russia, which intelligence agencies say hacked the Democrats in an effort to skew the election on his behalf, has crippled his ability to even talk about Russia’ illegal annexation of Crimea and its destabilizing behavior in Ukraine, Syria and Europe.

It was thus a momentary relief when Mr. Trump said, “e strongly support NATO,”acking off his earlier ambivalence toward the alliance. But he then trivialized the moment by insisting that his push for the allies to increase military spending had produced instant results and “he money is pouring in.”That isn’ the way NATO operates, and there isn’ any money pouring in anywhere.)

Presidential speeches are not as a rule detailed action plans, but a chance to illuminate priorities. On foreign policy, Mr. Trump has been hampered by his inexperience, narrow, protectionist impulses, and an erratic managing style that has made it hard to attract a capable staff. He has kept the focus on domestic issues, where he and his supporters seem more comfortable. As to America’ role in the world and its multiple challenges, he seems clueless and, at best, insecure.

Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. Reaction to President Trump’ address tended to focus on its sober style. His seriousness of purpose and calls for unity reassured —nd surprised —any listeners.

“ think it sounded great, like a utopia,”one voter said, adding, “ don’ think it’ that simple.”

Indeed, Mr. Trump, who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday, faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party.

Today’ episode of The Daily podcast examines the president’ speech to Congress, his call for unity and his promise to protect America. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device.

_____

2. Emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump administration, populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe are cracking on nongovernmental organizations once protected by Washington.

Groups that promote open government, aid refugees and often serve as checks on authoritarian governments are being targeted.

Organizations funded by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire, are facing particular ire, accused of working to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform “hristian”ations into multicultural stews of left-wing globalism.

_____

3. Developments in Syria this week: Russia mistakenly bombed Syrian fighters being trained by the U.S., another unintended clash among the myriad forces operating on the battlefield.

And U.N. investigators released a report detailing war crimes, calling the Syrian government’ bombing of a humanitarian convoy in September, which killed 14 aid workers, “ne of the most egregious.”

Next door in Iraq, the battle for Mosul continues. Our reporter met a family fleeing the \b ISIS\b0 -controlled portion of the city.

_____

4. Tornadoes lashed the Midwest, killing at least three people and leaving a trail of splintered homes, razed businesses and power outages.

The severe weather isn’ over yet. Forecasters said the Mid-Atlantic and Deep South were also at risk.

_____

5. Snap Inc. is losing money, but its valuation was set at $24 billion on the eve of its arrival on the New York Stock Exchange, one of the biggest market debuts in years.

Shares of the Snapchat parent company were priced at $17, higher than expected in an indication of strong demand.

_____

6. Scientists may have found the oldest signs of life on Earth. Or not.

Some researchers say ancient rocks in a remote geological outpost in Canada yielded bacteria fossils that could be up to 4.2 billion years old, relatively soon after the planet’ birth. Others are dubious —nd vocal.

Such battles, an optimist observed, are “ow science progresses.”

_____

7. In a sign that the era of the starchitect may be over, a modest team of three architects won their profession’ highest honor: the Pritzker Prize.

Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta set up shop in their hometown in Spain 30 years ago and are not well-known outside the country. Their major works include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, and the Sant Antoni –oan Oliver Library in Barcelona.

The award cited “heir intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally.”

_____

8. Los Angeles votes for mayor next Tuesday.

The incumbent, Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, faces some criticism for being “ureaucratic bland”ut seems assured of beating 10 challengers for a second term —nd possibly a bigger role in an embattled national party.

We caught up with him at an outdoor cafe downtown, where he sipped green tea, fielded requests for money from a homeless man, and said: “ think people mistake bloody noses for big accomplishments. Maybe because I don’ draw blood, but we actually work well with people, that that is seen as cautious.”

_____

9. Our tech writer says the sexism scandal at Uber feels like a watershed moment for Silicon Valley.

“his could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women —ot just at Uber but across the tech business, too,”e writes.

_____

10. Spring is almost here.

Here’ a guide to the season’ most promising live events, from Bette Midler’ star turn in “ello, Dolly!”o Chris Rock’ first standup tour in nearly a decade to The Weeknd’ new North American jaunt.

And don’ forget “roundhog Day,” new musical based on the hit film, coming to Broadway this spring after a London run. Above, Punxsutawney Phil, aka Raymond J. Lee, in transit.

_____

11. Finally, we’e been surfing the web for you. And we found lots of great stories that have nothing to do with politics.

For instance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’ fitness routine, Play-Doh’ special scent, the world’ worst skier and a trip to infinity.

Have a great night.

Donald Trump, Master of Low Expectations

First as a candidate, and now as president, Donald Trump has drawn fire for promising the moon and stars without giving the slightest hint of how he intended to obtain them. In fact, as Tuesday night’ speech to Congress demonstrated so clearly, the president is actually a master of the art of diminished expectations.

On Tuesday night, we are told, he looked sober and presidential, when all he actually did was read a speech from a Teleprompter without veering off into one of his incoherent rants. It’ hard to believe that even the ill-disciplined and narcissistic Trump would have stood in the well of the House of Representatives and tried to lead a chant of “ock her up”r slapped journalists with the “nemy of the people”abel that has been a favorite of dictators for more than a century.

Americans are supposed to be delighted, or at least relieved, that Trump began his speech by denouncing anti-Semitic threats and attacks, which have proliferated since he took office. But it took the president long weeks to make that simple statement, and just a few hours before his speech in the Capitol, he was suggesting to a group of state attorneys general that anti-Semitic attacks might actually have been carried out by people who want “o make others look bad”in other words, his political opponents).

At one point, Republican lawmakers in the chamber leapt to their feet, cheering in sycophantic approval, when Trump announced that he was going to put an end to the “ncontrolled entry”nto the United States of people “rom places where proper vetting cannot occur.”

This is a classic Trumpian stunt, inventing a problem and then promising to fix it. There is no free access for refugees to this country —t takes about two years to clear the vetting process —nd none of the fatal terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 have been committed by people from the seven countries Trump targeted with his anti-Muslim visa ban.

If Trump did nothing about immigration, he could cross “ncontrolled entry”ff his list because it’ not happening and it never has. Under Trump’ leadership, there won’ be any flying pigs, either, and Bigfoot will finally be prevented from tracking his muddy footprints through the Capitol Rotunda.

The Republicans dutifully roared their approval when Trump announced that he had “irected the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS.”pparently it had never occurred to President George W. Bush or President Obama to do that.

And he announced with a self-satisfied smirk that he had chosen a nominee for the Supreme Court “ho will defend our Constitution.”ll Supreme Court justices, from the most liberal to the most conservative, strive to defend the Constitution, and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. The question is how the justices interpret the country’ founding document.

Trump cited the fact that there are 43 million people on food stamps and living in poverty in the United States. That is indeed a shameful truth, but Trump didn’ actually promise to do anything about it.

Trump can keep on railing about law and order and promising to bring down the crime rate without worrying too much about it, because it’ coming down anyway. These days, Trump lies about record crime rates around the country when actually they are at historic lows. In a year or two, he’l be taking those same numbers and claiming credit for them.

The president talked a lot about national unity on Tuesday night, although I suspect that what he meant was that we should all unite behind his policies, behind his philosophy and, most important, behind him personally.

Trump declared that the “ime for small thinking is over,”resumably referring to his predecessor’ small ideas, like reforming health care, fighting racism and poverty, giving all Americans the right to marry the person they love and rallying allies who had been alienated by President Bush.

And Trump said the time for “rivial fights is behind us.”e just didn’ say which trivial fights he meant.

Protecting the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people? Safeguarding voting rights? Investigating whether members of the Trump team had colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election? Or maybe finally getting him to release his tax returns, as every other modern president has done?

Drone Strike Kills Senior Al Qaeda Leader

WASHINGTON — senior official of Al Qaeda was killed Sunday in Syria by a United States drone strike, an American official said on Wednesday.

The terrorist leader, Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, 59, was the second-ranking official after Ayman al-Zawahri and was a son-in-law to Al Qaeda’ founder, Osama bin Laden.

Jihadist social media carried reports of the attack on Sunday, including photos of the vehicle purportedly struck by the drone. The strike was said to have taken place in Idlib province in northwest Syria, where the Pentagon stepped up airstrikes against top Qaeda operatives in the last two months, killing several important figures.

Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and an expert on war in Syria, said in an email that the death of Mr. Masri was the most significant blow to Al Qaeda’ global network since the killing of Nasir al-Wuhayshi, Al Qaeda’ No. 2 official at the time, in a drone strike in Yemen in June 2015.

Mr. Masri was “ihadi royalty, meaning his death will almost certainly necessitate some form of response, whether from Syria or elsewhere in the world,”r. Lister said.

The killing of the Qaeda leader was previously reported by CNN and The Guardian. It was confirmed by an American official who declined to be identified because he was discussing classified intelligence reports

Photographs of the vehicle Mr. Masri was said to be traveling in when attacked reveal unusual details for such a strike: The vehicle sustained no major explosive damage, but a projectile clearly struck it directly through the car roof. This suggests the precision strike was either a dud or the United States deliberately used an inert warhead to kill its target by high-velocity impact, avoiding possible civilian casualties with an explosive warhead.

An Egyptian, Mr. Masri real’ name was Abdullah Muhammad Rajab Abd al-Rahman. A veteran of jihadi conflicts in Egypt, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, he was a longtime member of Al Qaeda’ highly secretive Shura Council, and was the terrorist group’ key intermediary with its affiliates and other jihadi groups across the world, Mr. Lister said.

His marriage to one of Osama bin Laden’ daughters placed him at the center of Al Qaeda’ hierarchy, and American counterterrorism officials believe he was directly involved in the 1998 bombing of American embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people.

After the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Masri fled to Iran, where he was reportedly put under house arrest along with other senior Qaeda leaders, including Saif al-Adel, the group’ strategic military chief. He was let go by the Iranians in March 2015 along with other Qaeda figures in exchange for an Iranian diplomat who had been kidnapped in Yemen by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Since then, Mr. Masri had operated in Syria as Al Qaeda’ deputy leader, providing orders and advice to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the Qaeda affiliate in Syria formerly known as the Nusra Front, and its leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, Mr. Lister said.

Al Qaeda and the Islamic State both operate in Syria. While the Islamic State has its roots in Al Qaeda’ franchise in Iraq, the two terrorist groups split and are now rivals in Syria. The Islamic State has carved out its self-proclaimed caliphate in the eastern part of the country, based in Raqqa. Al Qaeda’ affiliate in Syria is in the northwest and north-central part of the country, centered around Idlib.

The United States and its allies have mostly focused on conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, and on supporting a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground. American airstrikes against Qaeda targets in Syria only increased in the past two months.

In 2005, the United States Treasury Department described Mr. Masri as a Qaeda associate and said that he “as responsible for coordinating Al Qaeda’ work with other terrorist organizations.”

The drone strike against Mr. Masri came about a month after an Air Force B-52 bomber carried out a punishing airstrike against a training camp of Al Qaeda in Syria, which the Pentagon said killed about 100 militants.

That attack, which also included armed drones, was directed at the Shaykh Sulayman Training Camp in Idlib. Pentagon officials said it had been in operation for several years but had only recently become a base for “ore Al Qaeda”xtremists, who have largely come from outside Syria to fight and plot attacks. All told, 14 bombs and missiles were used in that attack.

The Pentagon disclosed in January that it also carried out an airstrike in Idlib province that killed Mohammad Habib Boussadoun al-Tunisi, described as a Qaeda leader linked to plots against Western targets.

Mr. Boussadoun went to Syria in 2014 after spending several years in Europe and other countries in the Middle East where he maintained ties with extremists, according to a Pentagon statement. Earlier in January, airstrikes killed two other Qaeda leaders, the Pentagon said.

Influential Health Fund Reboots Its Search for a Leader

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has announced that it is reopening its search for a new executive director.

The fund is influential in global health, disbursing about $5 billion a year to fight the three diseases -- a budget more than twice as large as the World Health Organization's.

The fund's board had expected to conclude the search for a replacement for the current executive director, Dr. Mark Dybul, this week at its annual retreat. But ''due to issues encountered in the recruitment process,'' board members were unable to finish, the fund said in a statement.

The selection process was conducted out of the public eye by a recruiting firm hired by the board's nominating committee. On Feb. 15, The New York Times reported that the committee had named three finalists: Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister; Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, a former Nigerian health minister; and Subhanu Saxena, a former pharmaceutical executive.

Dr. Pate, who was widely praised for his fight against polio in Nigeria, had a history of sharing articles on his Twitter feed that were highly unflattering to President Trump. One carried a headline referring to him as ''a fascist of some variety''; another said he had ''more in common with ISIS than America.''

The United States contributes a third of the Global Fund's budget, and some observers said they thought Dr. Pate's selection might hurt efforts to attract donations. Ms. Clark, frustrated with the process, withdrew from consideration.

On Feb. 20, leaders of the ''implementers group'' on the fund's board, representing countries and nonprofit organizations that receive money from the fund, expressed ''grave concerns'' about the process because ''key facts'' about candidates were missed, according to a letter to the board chairman, Norbert Hauser, obtained by The Times.

A majority of the implementers, the letter said, wanted the board to reopen the process, appoint a new nominating committee, hire a new recruitment agency, announce the names of candidates, hold a session at which the public could question them, and hold a town hall-style meeting at which staff members could air their views.

''Public events would offer candidates a chance to show their ability to manage and respond to questions and would re-emphasize the Fund's commitment to transparency,'' the letter read.

According to the rules of the process, no candidate can win without a two-thirds vote of the implementers group, along with two-thirds of the board's ''donor group.'' So delay appeared inevitable.

The letter by the implementers group also requested that the board create a transition committee, appoint an interim director, and manage the handover from Dr. Dybul, who is stepping down in May when his contract ends.

It also asked that any senior management changes or restructuring be delayed.

Trump's Military Preening

Why do I get the sense that fighter jets are Donald Trump's biceps, warships are his pectorals and what he's doing with his proposed $54 billion increase for the Pentagon is flexing?

Maybe because that's a strongman's way. Maybe because so much with him is preening. Or maybe because so little of his military talk adds up.

In a sweeping speech to Congress on Tuesday night that largely diverged from his splenetic norm, he laid out his vision for a better America, and a key part of it, he said, was ''one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.''

But he also lamented what he deemed our country's military follies of recent decades, sowing confusion in a careful listener. If we were winding down, why were we building up? If caution was the order of the day, why did it require such lavish investment?

Trump's address was an opportunity to change the narrative of his presidency from one of an administration in disarray to one of a man on a methodical mission, and to accomplish that, he donned a new kind of tie and a new kind of tone: less truculent, more inspirational. He began with a mention of Black History Month and a condemnation of hate crimes.

But his remarks didn't have sufficient details or offers of compromise to turn the page or to erase all the nonsense to date. Just a day earlier, at a meeting with the nation's governors, he maintained that when he was young, America was the proud victor in all of its wars.

Really? World War II wrapped up before Trump came along, and the Korean War, which ended when he was 7, was no unfettered American triumph.

Then came Vietnam, which found Trump in college and unable to serve because of a podiatric ailment so debilitating that he couldn't recall which foot was affected when he was asked about it in 2015. Surely, though, he remembers that Vietnam didn't continue some glorious winning streak.

In Trump's telling, everything about the America of yore was superior, everything about the America of today is wretched, and somehow, magically, he has solutions that even the most practiced hands don't.

That was a theme of his military musings during his campaign, when he touted a secret plan for defeating ISIS that he conveniently couldn't divulge, lest he trample on its secret-ness.

He subsequently ordered his top military advisers to come up with their own strategy, which makes a skeptical voter wonder what happened to his. Are the generals and he going to compare plans -- I'll show you mine if you show me yours -- to determine whose is mightiest? For now that's still a secret.

Details aren't his thing. He's all over the place. One moment, his chosen generals are sages for the ages. The next, he fingers them for any flaws in the Yemen raid during which a Navy SEAL, William Owens, who was called Ryan, died. ''They lost Ryan,'' he said on Tuesday morning.

But on Tuesday night, before Congress, they were geniuses anew, architects of a brilliantly successful operation. I was moved to see the effect of Trump's words on the SEAL's widow, Carryn, who stood in the audience, tears streaming down her face. I was also floored by the opportunistic shifts in Trump's take on those events.

He used his speech to complain once again that America was paying too much of the defense bill for our allies. He said that he was finally getting them to pony up.

If so, why do we need to pump tens of billions of additional dollars into the military, especially when we already spend more on it than the seven countries that spend the next most combined?

We can't afford the increase, not if Social Security and Medicare are off limits, not if he follows through with the tax cuts he promised, not if he's going to embark on the infrastructure projects that he's (rightly) calling for, not unless he's willing to gag Paul Ryan and shove him into some Capitol broom closet while the debt balloons.

And that increase doesn't square with all that Trump has said about being more reluctant to embroil us in military conflicts than some of his predecessors were.

I suppose he could argue that maximum military readiness is a deterrent, but does America's count of aircraft carriers really give jihadists pause? The wars that we're fighting aren't traditional ones, and they hinge on the kind of diplomacy and foreign aid that Trump is giving short shrift. But then soft power doesn't gleam or puff up the ego the way that new fighting equipment does.

His approach is provocative, antagonistic. He berates and bad-mouths allies in a fashion that threatens to push them away while promising a barrier along America's southern border and an upgrade of our nuclear arsenal.

He's saying that we can and will go it alone, and while that attitude may be emotionally satisfying to many Americans, it's not at all certain to keep us safe.

I suspect that it's emotionally satisfying to Trump most of all. He's determined to cast himself as a figure of epic proportions and has to size everything around him accordingly.

Hence his (latest) grandiose description of his election in Tuesday night's address. ''In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,'' he said, going on to mix metaphors as they've seldom been mixed before. ''Finally, the chorus became an earthquake.''

And hence his desire to upsize our armed forces. The military is one of his many mirrors. If it's more muscular, so is he.

President Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a partial transcript, as provided by the White House and prepared by the Federal News Service. The transcript will be updated as the speech continues.

For more coverage, read our live analysis.

TRUMP: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States, and citizens of America:

Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation’ path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’ shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.

Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice —n an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.

That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning.

A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.

And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.

What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.

Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.

All the nations of the world —riend or foe —ill find that America is strong, America is proud and America is free.

In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding —50 years since the day we declared our independence.

It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.

But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?

I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.

For too long, we’e watched our middle class shrink as we’e exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.

We’e financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit —nd so many other places throughout our land.

We’e defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross —nd for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.

And we’e spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds —amilies who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.

But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus —s thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake —nd the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again.

Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.

Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.

Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.

Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop.

And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.

Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.

It’ been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’e made in keeping those promises.

Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We’e saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government. We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.

We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five- year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials —nd a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.

We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.

We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines —hereby creating tens of thousands of jobs —nd I’e issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.

We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.

To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation.

We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth —nd we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone.

We want all Americans to succeed —ut that can’ happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.

For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.

As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I promised throughout the campaign.

To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or a loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?

Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.

According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home —rom Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center.

We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.

It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America —e cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe —nd to keep out those who would do us harm.

As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.

I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’ ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.

Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court —rom my list of 20 judges —ho will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.

Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.

Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.

Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.

More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.

We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.

In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.

We’e lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’e lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.

Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.

And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.

Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.

But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy —aking it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave our country.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.

My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

It will be a big, big cut. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.

We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes —ut when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.

At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it’ good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me —ithout even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it —hat it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.

They weren’ even asking for change. But I am.

I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.

The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “bandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.”

Lincoln was right —nd it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.

I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.

Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others – have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’ taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.

Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers’ages, and help struggling families – including immigrant families – enter the middle class.

I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’ security, and to restore respect for our laws.

If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

Donald Trump’ Military Preening; Op-Ed Columnist

Why do I get the sense that fighter jets are Donald Trump’ biceps, warships are his pectorals and what he’ doing with his proposed $54 billion increase for the Pentagon is flexing?

Maybe because that’ a strongman’ way. Maybe because so much with him is preening. Or maybe because so little of his military talk adds up.

In a sweeping speech to Congress on Tuesday night that largely diverged from his splenetic norm, he laid out his vision for a better America, and a key part of it, he said, was “ne of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.”

But he also lamented what he deemed our country’ military follies of recent decades, sowing confusion in a careful listener. If we were winding down, why were we building up? If caution was the order of the day, why did it require such lavish investment?

Trump’ address was an opportunity to change the narrative of his presidency from one of an administration in disarray to one of a man on a methodical mission, and to accomplish that, he donned a new kind of tie and a new kind of tone: less truculent, more inspirational. He began with a mention of Black History Month and a condemnation of hate crimes.

But his remarks didn’ have sufficient details or offers of compromise to turn the page or to erase all the nonsense to date. Just a day earlier, at a meeting with the nation’ governors, he maintained that when he was young, America was the proud victor in all of its wars.

Really? World War II wrapped up before Trump came along, and the Korean War, which ended when he was 7, was no unfettered American triumph.

Then came Vietnam, which found Trump in college and unable to serve because of a podiatric ailment so debilitating that he couldn’ recall which foot was affected when he was asked about it in 2015. Surely, though, he remembers that Vietnam didn’ continue some glorious winning streak.

In Trump’ telling, everything about the America of yore was superior, everything about the America of today is wretched, and somehow, magically, he has solutions that even the most practiced hands don’.

That was a theme of his military musings during his campaign, when he touted a secret plan for defeating ISIS that he conveniently couldn’ divulge, lest he trample on its secret-ness.

He subsequently ordered his top military advisers to come up with their own strategy, which makes a skeptical voter wonder what happened to his. Are the generals and he going to compare plans —’l show you mine if you show me yours —o determine whose is mightiest? For now that’ still a secret.

Details aren’ his thing. He’ all over the place. One moment, his chosen generals are sages for the ages. The next, he fingers them for any flaws in the Yemen raid during which a Navy SEAL, William Owens, who was called Ryan, died. “hey lost Ryan,”e said on Tuesday morning.

But on Tuesday night, before Congress, they were geniuses anew, architects of a brilliantly successful operation. I was moved to see the effect of Trump’ words on the SEAL’ widow, Carryn, who stood in the audience, tears streaming down her face. I was also floored by the opportunistic shifts in Trump’ take on those events.

He used his speech to complain once again that America was paying too much of the defense bill for our allies. He said that he was finally getting them to pony up.

If so, why do weneed to pump tens of billions of additional dollars into the military, especially when we already spend more on it than the seven countries that spend the next most combined?

We can’ afford the increase, not if Social Security and Medicare are off limits, not if he follows through with the tax cuts he promised, not if he’ going to embark on the infrastructure projects that he’ (rightly) calling for, not unless he’ willing to gag Paul Ryan and shove him into some Capitol broom closet while the debt balloons.

And that increase doesn’ square with all that Trump has said about being more reluctant to embroil us in military conflicts than some of his predecessors were.

I suppose he could argue that maximum military readiness is a deterrent, but does America’ count of aircraft carriers really give jihadists pause? The wars that we’e fighting aren’ traditional ones, and they hinge on the kind of diplomacy and foreign aid that Trump is giving short shrift. But then soft power doesn’ gleam or puff up the ego the way that new fighting equipment does.

His approach is provocative, antagonistic. He berates and bad-mouths allies in a fashion that threatens to push them away while promising a barrier along America’ southern border and an upgrade of our nuclear arsenal.

He’ saying that we can and will go it alone, and while that attitude may be emotionally satisfying to many Americans, it’ not at all certain to keep us safe.

I suspect that it’ emotionally satisfying to Trump most of all. He’ determined to cast himself as a figure of epic proportions and has to size everything around him accordingly.

Hence his (latest) grandiose description of his election in Tuesday night’ address. “n 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,”e said, going on to mix metaphors as they’e seldom been mixed before. “inally, the chorus became an earthquake.”

And hence his desire to upsize our armed forces. The military is one of his many mirrors. If it’ more muscular, so is he.

Influential Health Fund Reboots Its Search for a Leader

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced Monday that it would reopen its search for a new executive director.

The fund is influential in global health, disbursing about $5 billion a year to fight the three diseases — budget more than twice as large as the World Health Organization’.

The fund’ board had expected to conclude the search for a replacement for the current executive director, Dr. Mark Dybul, this week at its annual retreat. But “ue to issues encountered in the recruitment process,”oard members were unable to finish, the fund said in a statement.

The selection process was conducted out of the public eye by a recruiting firm hired by the board’ nominating committee. On Feb. 15, The New York Times reported that the committee had named three finalists: Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister; Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, a former Nigerian health minister; and Subhanu Saxena, a former pharmaceutical executive.

Dr. Pate, who was widely praised for his fight against polio in Nigeria, had a history of sharing articles on his Twitter feed that were highly unflattering to President Trump. One carried a headline referring to him as “ fascist of some variety” another said he had “ore in common with ISIS than America.”

The United States contributes a third of the Global Fund’ budget, and some observers said they thought Dr. Pate’ selection might hurt efforts to attract donations. Ms. Clark, frustrated with the process, withdrew from consideration.

On Feb. 20, leaders of the “mplementers group”n the fund’ board, representing countries and nonprofit organizations that receive money from the fund, expressed “rave concerns”bout the process because “ey facts”bout candidates were missed, according to a letter to the board chairman, Norbert Hauser, obtained by The Times.

A majority of the implementers, the letter said, wanted the board to reopen the process, appoint a new nominating committee, hire a new recruitment agency, announce the names of candidates, hold a session at which the public could question them, and hold a town hall-style meeting at which staff members could air their views.

“ublic events would offer candidates a chance to show their ability to manage and respond to questions and would re-emphasize the Fund’ commitment to transparency,”he letter read.

According to the rules of the process, no candidate can win without a two-thirds vote of the implementers group, along with two-thirds of the board’ “onor group.”o delay appeared inevitable.

The letter by the implementers group also requested that the board create a transition committee, appoint an interim director, and manage the handover from Dr. Dybul, who is stepping down in May when his contract ends.

It also asked that any senior management changes or restructuring be delayed.

Season 1, Episode 3

In 1921, Greenwood, Okla., a suburb of Tulsa that was home to a thriving and prosperous black community, was burned to the ground by a white mob. The community, colloquially referred to as “lack Wall Street, represented a legacy that black people are still trying to rebuild. It is estimated that as many as 300 black people were killed and more than 8,000 were left homeless. But what’ most profound was the silence that followed. It was only in 2012 that this brutal event began to be taught in Tulsa’ public schools. Its lack of historical prominence carries a lesson many black people in America learn in one way or another —egacies are important and can easily be rewritten by outside forces.

In this week’ episode of “he Good Fight,”oseman suggests that Barbara’ insistence on putting Lucca on Diane’ case is simply a power play. But Barbara’ sly insults indicate her fear and speak to something far more complex. Her machinations speak to a desire to cement the legacy of the firm that bears her name so it won’ come undone like many black institutions —ike Greenwood —ave throughout American history. The presence of Maia, Marissa and Diane disrupt the image of the company, a historically all-black law firm in a overwhelmingly segregated city. Nothing explosive happens, but there is enough tension to suggest that the polite smiles will only last for so long.

The show shares more than a little DNA with “he Good Wife.”howrunners Robert and Michelle King continue to show an interest in the ways technology affects modern life. Here, Diane’ client, Dr. Picot (Zachary Knighton), is arrested after guiding a dentist in Syria to perform open-heart surgery over video chat. The opening is expertly constructed, utilizing silence and a fine eye for details like Jax’ (Tom McGowan) bare feet to place us firmly in Maia’ perspective.

Dr. Picot’ arrest on conspiracy for aiding a man suspected of terrorism introduces several moral quagmires ripe for exploration. Did Dr. Picot really know that the man on the operating table in Syria was suspected of being a terrorist? And if he did, what does that mean in terms of his responsibilities as a health care professional? The case ends up being an elaborate ruse. It isn’ the man on the operating table that is linked to ISIS, but rather his brother, whom the government wanted to draw out of hiding. The ending, in which everyone in the makeshift Syria hospital is killed, ultimately makes this story a lesson in futility. The case lacks the emotional pull and moral complexity it deserves. But it does introduce a fascinating new character, Assistant United States Attorney Colin Morello (Justin Bartha).

Colin and Lucca obviously share some history, the particulars of which remain hinted at but never explained. There is an intimacy that comes across in every witty barb and flirtatious glance they cast at each other. Their dynamic helps the main story line rise above its relative flatness. Unfortunately, the rest of the episode doesn’ have anything to distract from the racial quandaries it ignores.

Barbara and Boseman are in the tricky position of potentially losing a client because of the shifting political climate created by the presidency of Donald J. Trump. If they lose a bid with a telephone company they’e represented for years, it would put the firm in dire financial straits. The two lawyers scramble to find one person in their firm who voted for Trump in order to curry favor during the bid. Julian Cain (Michael Boatman) proves to be the only lawyer willing to acknowledge that he voted for Trump. This sets up a fascinating thread about black politics, liberal identity and what the firm represents.

Unfortunately it goes nowhere. Writer Tegan Shohet brings no nuance to a politically fraught episode. Julian’ newly discovered conservatism alienates him from his colleagues even though he triumphantly wins the bid for the firm. The meaningful glances and whispers from the other lawyers hint at the profound discomfort that differing politics can inject into relationships. But that’ as far as the story goes in delving into the ways that Julian’ voting record may upset the culture of this proudly liberal firm, which repeatedly represents victims in police brutality cases.

A series with a majority black cast that is willing to explore power plays, identity and the current political climate has some rich material to work with going forward. “he Good Fight”ouched on the idea of legacies among women in the premiere, when Diane effectively passed a torch to Maia. But it is the legacy that Barbara seeks to ensure, weighted by a thorny American history full of events like the Greenwood race riots, that has the most potential. After three episodes, the series has yet to prove that it is capable of meaningfully developing that material.

Other Gossip

•aia mostly exists in the margins as she successfully gets a list that Henry requested from Jax’ computer. Maia provides flashes of humor and suspense as she outwits Jax. But for the most part this narrative is all setup, no reward.

•“hat’ the real truth about your dad,”ax tells Maia. “e didn’ want to steal people’ money. He just wanted to be seen as a winner.”t’ a pronouncement she obviously doesn’ take to heart. The problem with Maia is that she still sees the world split neatly into heroes and villains.

• like the newly introduced investigator at the firm, Jay (Nyambi Nyambi). He seems sly and curious in a way that makes him immediately stand out. That Diane unknowingly thanks Marissa for the work Jay did in finding a witness suggests that the tension at the firm shows no signs of lessening.

WE’L ALWAYS HAVE CASABLANCA

The Life, Legend, and Afterlife of Hollywood’ Most Beloved Movie

By Noah Isenberg

Illustrated. 334 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95.

HIGH NOON

The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic

By Glenn Frankel

Illustrated. 379 pp. Bloomsbury. $28.

It’ a strange but serendipitous coincidence that two books devoted to Hollywood classics, “asablanca”nd “igh Noon,”re being published at the same time. The films, released a scant 10 years apart in 1942 and 1952 respectively, are perfect bookends, spot-on reflections of the times in which they were made, and therefore dramatically different. And in the era of the Trump presidency, these books are charged by an immediacy they otherwise might not enjoy.

“asablanca”rrived just short of a year after the United States declared war on Germany. In it, Humphrey Bogart’ Rick Blaine, whose mantra is “ stick my neck out for nobody,”amously does just that, shrugging off the neutrality that had been American policy until Pearl Harbor, and helping his former flame Ingrid Bergman and the Czech resistance hero Paul Henreid escape the Nazis. The film also includes a memorably inspirational episode of collective defiance, as the refugees, con men and adventurers in Rick’ place join in a rousing rendition of the “arseillaise,”rowning out German officers who are singing “ie Wacht am Rhein.”

“igh Noon,”n the other hand, is a profile in collective cowardice. The United States was in the grip of the Red Scare, and the marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper), can’ find a single good man in the dusty Western town of Hadleyville to help him confront the Miller brothers and their gang, who have sworn to kill him. Coop prevails, naturally, but his triumph fails to dispel the toxic fog of betrayal and disillusion that shrouds the story.

“e’l Always Have Casablanca”as written by Noah Isenberg, the director of screen studies at the New School, and probably best known for a biography of Edgar G. Ulmer, a B-film director much beloved by cineastes. Here, Isenberg gives us the soup-to-nuts on “asablanca,”utifully making his way through script, casting, production and reception, to the inevitable squabbling over credit, all the while trying to account for its enduring popularity.

“asablanca”as rooted in a trip that the aspiring playwright Murray Burnett and his wife took to Vienna in the summer of 1938, just after they were married. Austria had overwhelmingly voted to serve itself up to the German Anschluss that March, and was busy implementing the notorious Nuremberg Laws. Burnett quickly discovered that it was not the best place for Jews on their honeymoon. But getting out of Vienna was considerably harder than getting in, especially since Burnett, wearing diamond rings on every finger, and his wife, wearing a fur coat in August, were smuggling out valuables belonging to relatives. When they reached the South of France, they stopped at a cafe full of refugees and army officers. Burnett said to his wife, “hat a setting for a play.”

Burnett developed his play with his writing partner, Joan Alison, but could not get it produced. He did, however, manage to sell it to Warner Brothers, generally known for its progressive pictures, and in particular a series of anti-Nazi films like “onfessions of a Nazi Spy,”eleased in 1939, when other studios were still trying to protect their German assets.

Nobody involved with “asablanca”ad high expectations for the picture, although it was written by the colorful Epstein twins, Julius and Philip, and Howard Koch. The Epsteins were widely admired for their witty dialogue, on and off screen. Of the film, Julius once said, “here wasn’ one moment of reality in ‘asablanca.’e weren’ making art. We were making a living.”evertheless, when it was released, it became an instant hit, and won three Oscars, including best picture. It’ all in Isenberg’ account, and “asablanca”ans will find it to be a treasure trove of facts and anecdotes.

“igh Noon”s a far deeper dig into the background and historical context of its subject; that is, the sorry history of the blacklist, instituted by the studios after the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) put a gun to their collective heads in 1947.

Despite the voluminous literature on the subject, surprisingly little has been written about “igh Noon.”or many years, Billy Wilder’ unfriendly words about the so-called Unfriendly Ten who refused to answer questions before HUAC —“nly two of them have talent. The rest are just unfriendly”—assed for the conventional wisdom. Even though Carl Foreman, who hatched the story and wrote the script, had more —nd better —redits than most of his blacklisted confreres, unlike them he didn’ live to finish writing his memoirs. The director, Fred Zinnemann, never made it into the film critic Andrew Sarris’ famous Pantheon, and the producer, Stanley Kramer, was condescended to by intellectuals for his message movies.

Glenn Frankel comes to his subject with a widely praised book about John Ford’ “he Searchers”nd an impressive réumén journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize. Although much of Frankel’ material is familiar, the blacklist is a gift that keeps on giving. There always seems to be something new to chew on, in this case the transcripts of HUAC’ secret executive sessions. Besides, it’ a story that bears retelling because Hollywood, not to mention the rest of the country, is haunted by ghosts that won’ go away (witness Newt Gingrich’ recent call for a resurrection of HUAC, now to be wielded against ISIS, not Communists).

At first HUAC was considered something of a joke, but as time passed, the committee’ antics became more scary than risible. Like much of the Hollywood left, Humphrey Bogart supported the 19 “nfriendly”creenwriters initially called before the committee. He had backed Franklin Roosevelt in his 1944 presidential campaign, and when he was attacked by the right, he struck a defiant note in The Saturday Evening Post. Alluding to his role in “asablanca,”e wrote, “’ going to keep right on sticking my neck out, without worrying about its possible effect upon my career.”ut a brief three years later, when the right turned up the heat, he published an abject apologia in Photoplay magazine entitled, “’ No Communist,”n which he distanced himself from the Ten. Likewise, Jack Warner, whose studio had invented the anti-fascist genre, gave HUAC the names of 16 screenwriters, including those of the Epstein twins, of whom he said, “hose boys are always on the side of the underdog.”oreman didn’ intend his script to be the blacklist parable it became, but as he watched his friends fall around him, it was almost inevitable. Foreman felt like the Gary Cooper character. He regarded “igh Noon”s a picture about “onscience”ersus “ompromise.”

Surprisingly, it is Gary Cooper, a card-carrying conservative, who emerges as one of the few heroes of this story. Called before HUAC in the middle of production, Foreman gave his star the opportunity to leave the picture —uilt by association was de rigueur in those days —ut Cooper refused. Foreman declined to name names, and Kramer fired him. In “asablanca,”he so-called refugee trail led from Europe to America. During the witch hunt years, it went the other way. Moving to London, Foreman said goodbye to his country, his livelihood and, eventually, his marriage. Cooper tried to help him by buying stock in his new company, but bullied by the likes of John Wayne and Hedda Hopper, he eventually pulled out, albeit cordially. If Foreman had thought that art was imitating life in “igh Noon,”nce Cooper caved it seemed clear that at least in his life, unlike Marshal Will Kane’, there were no happy endings.

Frankel narrates this story well. He has a sure ear for the telling anecdote, and a good eye for detail. (Parnell Thomas chaired the HUAC hearings sitting on a phone book covered by a red cushion to compensate for his diminutive stature.) The era has been labeled “he plague years,”ut Frankel is forgiving of those caught up in its tangle of principle and expediency, courage and cowardice. He adopts the verdict of Dalton Trumbo, another of the Unfriendly Ten: “here were only victims.”

First Big Test for Mattis: Pitch Plans to Fight  ISIS  and Not Alienate Trump

WASHINGTON -- As Defense Secretary Jim Mattis prepares to submit his first big pitch to his new boss -- options for accelerating the fight against the Islamic State -- he is balancing the need to rein in President Trump's more extreme impulses without distancing himself too much and losing White House favor.

Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, has already assumed an outsize role in the administration -- part valued aide to the new president, who has quickly come to adore him, and part reassurer in chief to global leaders, who cling to his every utterance in the hope that he will help keep the White House from undoing decades of national security policy.

Nowhere is this juggling act clearer than in the decisions confronting Mr. Mattis about speeding the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump made that fight a centerpiece of his national security strategy during the campaign, saying he would give his generals 30 days to produce a plan to defeat the group, and he has urged an alliance with Russia to combat the militants in Syria. But such a move is anathema to Mr. Mattis, who has said repeatedly that he does not view Russia as a trustworthy partner.

For all of Mr. Trump's bombast about the fight against the Islamic State -- he said as a candidate that he would ''bomb the hell'' out of the militants, ''take out'' their families and ''take the oil'' -- Pentagon leaders said they were preparing more nuanced options.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested last week that the initial plan may extend beyond the Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria and that it may look at how the militant group rose to power in the first place, and how to fight its ideology.

''This is not about Syria and Iraq,'' General Dunford said at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

The Islamic State, he noted, at one point numbered 45,000 foreign fighters from more than 100 countries. ''Our plan, to be successful, needs to, No. 1, cut the connective tissue between regional groups that now form a transregional threat.''

Mr. Mattis will probably present Mr. Trump a range of options that include loosening some battlefield restrictions and allowing American troops to get closer to the fight. He may also recommend putting a limited number of additional troops on the ground in Syria.

But Pentagon officials said there was little appetite in the Defense Department for a full-fledged American military mission in Syria that would include thousands of additional combat troops. Any such move could leave the United States responsible for picking up the pieces after a defeat of the Islamic State.

General Dunford said the Pentagon's goal was to outline the options for dealing with the Islamic State while at the same time making clear ''the risks associated with each one.''

With the firing of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and the arrival of Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster in his place, Mr. Mattis's hand has been strengthened in the national security structure. Like Mr. Mattis, General McMaster has no previous links to Mr. Trump and is not seen as being driven by ideology, which could not be said about Mr. Flynn.

A battle-tested veteran of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and the Iraq war, General McMaster, like Mr. Mattis, is considered to be one of the military's most independent-minded officers.

After Mr. Trump's first choice -- Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral who is a former Navy SEAL -- declined the national security adviser job, Mr. Mattis encouraged General McMaster to take it, turning what could have been a disastrous turn of events for him into a success.

Inside the Pentagon, civilian and military officials appear to be relishing the fact that, so far, Mr. Mattis has protected them from many of the ups and downs coming out of the White House.

During a recent talk with policy officials at the Defense Department, Mr. Mattis told people to stay strong and keep going in the right direction -- in many cases, largely the direction that they had already been going, according to a former senior military official who speaks frequently to his former colleagues. The former official said Mr. Mattis appeared to be pushing for greater expertise in the Pentagon and had asked officials not to change jobs so frequently that they are not able to become true experts.

An avid reader, Mr. Mattis also says he wants the Defense Department's regional desks to be able to think the way people in their respective countries would think, officials said. He wants military officials to have read the literature of the country in which they specialize and to really understand the countries, not just the issues that affect bilateral relations with the United States.

At the Pentagon last week, Mr. Mattis showed up unannounced and without aides in the Middle East policy office to ask a question of one of the desk officers.

He has already been on two overseas diplomatic missions in the month since Mr. Trump took power. He went to Asia, where he reassured South Korean and Japanese officials that, contrary to Mr. Trump's campaign musings that they should perhaps develop their own nuclear weapons to save the United States money that it now spends to protect them, the United States was not going to abandon decades of nonproliferation policy.

He went to Europe, where he reassured nations that, contrary to Mr. Trump's postcampaign musings that NATO was ''obsolete,'' the United States still valued the trans-Atlantic alliance.

And he went to Iraq, saying before arriving in Baghdad that, contrary to Mr. Trump's musings, ''We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil.''

Some Defense Department officials privately expressed concern about whether Mr. Mattis, in reassuring American allies, might alienate the White House.

U.S. Forces Play Crucial Role Against  ISIS  in Mosul

HAMAM AL-ALIL, Iraq -- One week after Iraqi forces began their push into western Mosul, American firepower is playing an essential role in softening the opposition from the Islamic State.

The thunderous booms from howitzers near Hamam al-Alil, a town along the Tigris River, are just part of the American military's contribution to keeping the Iraqi offensive moving forward.

Capt. Geoffrey Ross, who commands the unit of self-propelled artillery here, said his soldiers had been a lot busier than he had anticipated.

''It's considerably more than we thought we were going to shoot when we left Fort Hood,'' he said on Saturday, as one of his howitzers hurled another round toward Mosul, 15 miles to the northwest.

At Qayyarah Airfield West, a sprawling Iraq base 40 miles south of Mosul, a United States Army task force fires Himars satellite-guided rockets at targets. Apache attack helicopters, equipped with Hellfire missiles, stand ready to carry out their missions from the base's airfield.

Not to mention the punishing airstrikes by American and allied warplanes and drones. A flurry of attacks were carried out by the American-led coalition in and around Mosul on Saturday, some involving the dropping of multiple bombs.

That firepower, the decision to position American advisers closer to the fighting, and the determined efforts of the Iraqi forces themselves have yielded some notable gains. Iraq's federal police have fully secured the Mosul airport, while Iraq's elite counterterrorism service seized a nearby military base last week.

That ground has been taken at a cost. Four Iraqis were killed in action and 53 wounded on Friday, according to an American official who requested anonymity to discuss the statistics, which have yet to be officially published. That is a small fraction of the approximately 500 dead and 3,000 wounded that Iraqi forces suffered in their push to secure the eastern half of the city during an earlier, 100-day offensive.

But the toughest part of the battle -- the house-to-house combat in the narrow streets of the old part of western Mosul -- still lies ahead. The Islamic State's military tactics have also added to the challenge.

With the encouragement of the Americans, the Iraqi strategy has been to mount an attack on multiple axes to present the militants with more problems than they can handle. But the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has responded at times by concentrating its firepower on what it believes to be the Iraqis' main line of attack.

In ISIS' version of combined arms warfare, it has sent drones equipped with bombs even as it lobbed mortars and deployed suicide car bombers, whom the militants use as a primitive but often effective way to deliver precision-guided munitions.

Iraqi troops have been spooked by the ISIS drones, which sometimes hover in swarms of three to five. Neither the American nor the Iraqi military has an easy remedy. Trying to jam the drones might interfere with the Iraqis' own communications, and it is not always easy to shoot them out of the sky.

So the United States military has used its firepower to try to mitigate the drone problem, just as it targeted ISIS' car bomb factories, mortar teams and command posts. On Saturday, the American-led command announced that it had struck a ''staging area'' for launching drones and a cache of the weapons.

Qayyarah West, which was once known as Saddam Airbase and is called Q-West by American soldiers, is a pivotal base for the Mosul offensive. Runways at the air base, captured from the Islamic State in July, have been repaired by American combat engineers, which makes it an important logistics hub and a useful platform for projecting power.

First Lt. Mary Floyd, a 24-year-old officer who was raised in South Carolina, has been focused on doing exactly that. The commander of a platoon that fires Himars rockets, she helped flatten a five-story building the American military says Islamic State militants were using as a command post shortly before the Iraqis began their offensive to take western Mosul.

Over the past week, she said, her platoon launched rockets toward Mosul 10 to 20 times. Military officers have a name for the two platoons that fire Himars that are deployed at the base: Task Force Thor.

Firing rockets into a densely populated city is a tricky proposition. But the rockets' satellite guidance, perpendicular angle of attack and the fact that they can accommodate a relatively small warhead have led the military to turn to it during previous urban fights, including the 2006 battle for Ramadi and the 2007 struggle for the control of Haifa Street in Baghdad.

The United States is not the only nation supporting the Iraqis by firing artillery. French artillery has been active as well.

Hamam al-Alil was taken by Iraqi forces in November, and a mass grave of ISIS victims was later uncovered near an agricultural college there. Now, United States Army crews live and even sleep inside their Paladin artillery units, waiting for orders to fire.

Captain Ross declined to say precisely how many rounds his soldiers had fired. But he said they were ready to shoot day and night and could ''range the entire city.''

Thousands Left Tunisia to Join  ISIS . Now the Worry Is Their Return.

TUNIS -- Tunisia has sent more fighters abroad to join the ranks of the Islamic State than any other country. And now, as the Islamic State takes a battering on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, the country is at odds over what to do if and when they come home.

Tunisians have been dealing with a frenzied polemic in recent weeks, as secularists have raised fears that a returning wave will bring further mayhem to this fragile state and Islamists have been forced to condemn the jihadists.

''How can we accept those people who are professionals in war, in the use of arms and have a culture of being terrorists?'' asked Badra Gaaloul, a civil-military analyst who heads the International Center of Strategic, Security and Military Studies. ''We in Tunisia are in crisis, and we cannot accept these people.''

''It is a nightmare for Tunisia,'' she added. ''We are not ready for that.''

The concern is not academic. Ms. Gaaloul, among others, points to the experience of Algeria, which suffered through a decade-long insurgency in the 1990s when jihadists returned from Afghanistan set on establishing Islamic law, and the army led a brutal war to crush them.

Already there are signs that some of the 5,500 Tunisians who have gone abroad, according to United Nations estimates, are seeking new targets at home and in Europe, where Tunisians have been implicated in several recent terrorist cases in France and Germany.

For Tunisia, there is no easy solution. The new Constitution does not allow the government to bar them. They can be locked up for joining a terrorist group, or for committing crimes abroad, but cases are hard to build and charges difficult to prove. The president proposed amnesty, only to be vigorously opposed.

So the country has settled into a harsh, and potentially illegal, system of monitoring. Domestic opponents and international rights groups, including Human Rights Watch last year and Amnesty International in a report issued in February, are protesting it as counterproductive.

The threat of imprisonment and torture is deterring many from returning home, in effect rendering them stateless. Some are hiding in Turkey and Europe, where they may be ticking time bombs.

There is no government program to de-radicalize returning fighters or reintegrate them into society, said Ridha Raddaoui, a lawyer and co-author of a new report on terrorism in Tunisia by the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. Families of suspects and fighters who have returned are persecuted rather than supported, he said.

''The methods are pushing people to terrorism,'' Mr. Raddaoui said. ''We think the victims of terrorism are also the families.''

Tunisian fighters still hold prominent positions in the Islamic State and the Nusra Front in Syria. But of greater threat to Tunisia are those in Libya affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is active in a half-dozen countries across North Africa and vows to bring Islamic rule to Tunisia and all of North Africa.

''Their aim is still to destabilize the state,'' said Col. Mokhtar Ben Nasr, who heads military analysis at the Tunisian Center for Global Security Studies. ''They want to make people rise up over poverty and injustice, and they do propaganda to that effect.''

The violence the returning fighters and others who have been radicalized can sow has already been witnessed in Tunisia, which has suffered a drastic rise in instability and terrorism since the Arab Spring uprising of 2010-11.

After the revolution, Qaeda followers, released from prison or returned from exile, were quick to exploit the new freedoms, taking over the mosques and establishing a network of cells across the country and training camps in Libya.

While many interpreted the Arab Spring as proof that people power was more potent that terrorism, Al Qaeda was faster to organize than any other political movement and became the main terrorist threat to the country, according to the report on terrorism.

''The terrorist current was one of the main beneficiaries of the Tunisian revolution,'' the report concludes. ''From the first months it quickly profited from the release of its detained members and from the climate of freedom to rebuild itself.''

Terrorists benefited from outside support, but their growth was critically linked to Tunisia's internal problems, the report also said.

By 2013, insurgents were embedded in the mountains on the western border with Algeria, and groups in the cities began a campaign of political assassinations, ambushes on the police and army, and suicide attacks.

Since then, Tunisia has been hit by more than 50 terrorist attacks, including increasingly spectacular assaults orchestrated by groups based in Libya.

More than 70 people were killed in mass shootings in 2015, many of them foreign tourists at the national Bardo Museum in Tunis and at a beach resort in Sousse. A suicide attacker killed 12 members of the presidential guard in central Tunis in November the same year.

In their most ambitious attack to date, hundreds of Tunisian fighters tried to seize control of the Tunisian border town of Ben Gardane in March last year and fought Tunisian security forces in the streets for several hours.

Tunisian officials insist their security forces are getting a grip on terrorism inside the country. Indeed, the rate of attacks has fallen off in recent months.

''There has been a lot of work by the police and army,'' Colonel Ben Nasr said. ''They have dismantled the logistics and recruitment networks, and there is no longer this support system that there was in 2012 and 2013.''

United States airstrikes in Libya last February targeted a major Tunisian camp, where the perpetrators of the 2015 attacks had trained, and helped push the Islamic State out of the city of Surt -- both major blows to the jihadists in Libya.

Up to 400 Tunisian fighters were killed in Libya in the past year, according to Libyan security forces, yet hundreds remain at large, dispersed around the country and in camps in southern Libya. Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, called on Tunisians in a recent audio message to wage jihad to ''excise tyranny'' from the country.

Researchers studying radicalization in Tunisia say police harassment is still pushing young people to run off and join the extremists.

''Their territory is diminishing but not their numbers,'' said Mohamed Iqbal Ben Rejeb, who founded the Rescue Association of Tunisians Trapped Abroad after his brother was recruited to fight in Syria.

In December, President Béi Caï Essebsi of Tunisia floated the idea of a pardon for returning fighters, saying there was no more room in the prisons. But after opposition protesters flooded the news media and television chat shows, he ruled out the idea, promising there would be no pardon and no amnesty.

Islamist leaders, who have been sympathetic to young jihadists, have joined him in insisting that all returning fighters go before the courts on their return.

''Those who survive will have to go before justice and pay for what they did,'' Abdelfattah Mourou, a co-founder of the Ennahda party and deputy speaker of Parliament, said in an interview. ''They killed people, and they have to pay.''

But human rights activists and others say that leaving the jihadists no way out allows the cycle of radicalization to continue. Mr. Ben Rejeb said he knew of dozens of Tunisians who wanted to come home, many of them trapped in jails in Syria and Libya.

The government will not be able to stop fighters from returning, said Mr. Raddaoui, the lawyer, and it may well find it difficult to pin crimes on them for lack of evidence. ''There are no autopsies, no police reports,'' he said of the crimes committed on distant battlefields.

Of greater concern, Mr. Raddaoui said, is that in reading the court papers of the 500 Tunisians who have been processed since their return, he has seen no remorse.

''What they admit to, they do not regret at all,'' he said.

KABUL, Afghanistan -- At least 10 police officers and the wife of a police commander were killed in an ambush by Islamic State militants in the northern province of Zawzjan, a provincial official said on Saturday.

Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the Zawzjan provincial governor, said that the police officers were ambushed Friday as they left a mosque. The wife of the police commander heard about her husband being shot and rushed to the scene, where she was also killed.

Militants linked to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have been active in Afghanistan's eastern regions, but have recently begun operating in the north of the country as well.

The Interior Ministry said in a statement that around 38 militants, including 23 Islamic State fighters, were killed in separate operations conducted by Afghan security forces in the eastern and southern regions of the country over the past two days.

Eight other militants were wounded and six were arrested in the operations, which were conducted in districts across the Nangarhar and Helmand provinces, the statement added.

In Laghman Province, in the east, two students were killed when a mortar shell struck a school classroom, a news release from the Education Ministry said. The statement said that five other students were wounded inside the classroom in Mihterlam, the province's capital.

There were unconfirmed reports that the mortar was fired by Afghan security forces and missed its target and hit the school. The report could not immediately be verified by provincial or government officials.

Targeted by  ISIS , Egyptian Christians Flee Violence

CAIRO —ozens of Egyptian Christian families fled their homes in the northern Sinai Peninsula on Friday, driven by a targeted campaign of Islamist violence that has killed at least seven people in recent weeks.

People flooded into a church compound in the city of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. Many had fled hurriedly with little more than their clothes and their children. Their flight had been prompted by the release of an Islamic State video on Sunday that vowed to step up attacks on the embattled Christian minority in Sinai.

The video was followed, in recent days, by a series of attacks by gunmen in El Arish, the main town in northern Sinai. On Thursday, a plumber in the city was shot dead in front of his wife and children at their home, according to aid workers and Christian leaders.

A day earlier, gunmen killed another man before his pregnant wife, then calmly drank a bottle of Pepsi before taking off, witnesses told aid workers in Ismailia.

“hey want to send a message that nobody is safe,”aid Mina Thabet, who works with the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and who helped with the emergency effort in Ismailia.

The killings represent an escalation of a campaign announced by the Islamic State in December, when a suicide bomber struck a prominent Cairo church  during Sunday Mass, killing about 30 people. The group says it wants to wage sectarian war in Egypt, much as it has already done in parts of Iraq and Syria.

Coptic Christians in Egypt, who account for about 10 percent of the country’ population, are the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Although they have been subjected to increasing violence in recent years, the Islamic State campaign is an alarming turn.

“s the Islamic State comes under pressure in Iraq and Syria, it has to show movement on other fronts,”aid Zack Gold, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council , an international affairs research organization. “ne of them is to demonstrate that it is still fighting a sectarian war.”

Hossam Rafaei, a lawmaker from North Sinai, said that about 90 Christian families had arrived in Ismailia. After receiving help at a church, some have been put in government housing, while others found private accommodations.

Mr. Rafaei said his constituents were in a “tate of war,”ut another lawmaker from the area, Rahmi Abd Rabbo, tried to play down the violence, claiming that no more than five families had fled from Sinai. “t is not about being Muslim or Christian,”e said. “olice and military people are targeted, too.”

But fleeing Christians spoke of death lists compiled by militants and attacks in which militants had set houses on fire or burned the bodies of their victims. Many said they had no choice but to flee.

“hings were never this bad,”aid one man from El Arish, speaking by phone. “hey killed a couple of church leaders in the past, but the killings were far apart. Now we are told that are were making lists of all the Copts there.”

The man spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing for his life.

Aid workers in Ismailia estimated that at least 250 people had taken shelter in the city in churches and other safe places.

On Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi instructed his security chiefs to “ompletely eradicate terrorism in northern Sinai,”ccording to a statement issued by his office. But angry Copts also blamed Mr. Sisi’ Egyptian security forces for failing to protect them. The security forces have been battling Islamist militants in Sinai for years. 

“he state allowed hate speech to flourish, and over time that has turned into action,”aid Michel Antoune, an Evangelical church leader from Ismailia helping the refugees. “his the natural result of state indifference.”

Earlier on Friday, Mr. Antoune helped the wife of Kamel Youssef, the plumber who had been shot dead in El Arish on Thursday. “he broke our hearts,”r. Antoune said. “e did not know what to say to her.”

The violence against Christians could become a topic of discussion for the White House visit planned by Mr. Sisi in the coming months.

President Trump has made counterterrorism a central part of his Middle East policy. Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. Sisi, praising him as a “antastic guy,”espite criticism from human rights groups about Egypt’ dismal human rights record.

The Islamic State affiliate in Sinai is small compared with Iraq or Syria, but it has been increasingly active in recent weeks. It has carried out two rocket attacks on Israel in the past two weeks. There were no reported casualties, and Israel’ defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said in a newspaper interview that such attacks, while “exing,”id not pose a major security threat.

Their flight had been prompted by the release of an Islamic State video on Sunday that vowed to step up attacks on the embattled Christian minority in Sinai.

The video was followed, in recent days, by a series of attacks by gunmen in El Arish, the main town in northern Sinai. On Thursday, a plumber in the city was shot dead in front of his wife and children at their home, according to aid workers and Christian leaders.

A day earlier, gunmen killed another man before his pregnant wife, then calmly drank a bottle of Pepsi before taking off, witnesses told aid workers in Ismailia.

''They want to send a message that nobody is safe,'' said Mina Thabet, who works with the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and who helped with the emergency effort in Ismailia.

The killings represent an escalation of a campaign announced by the Islamic State in December, when a suicide bomber struck a prominent Cairo church during Sunday Mass, killing about 30 people. The group says it wants to wage sectarian war in Egypt, much as it has already done in parts of Iraq and Syria.

Coptic Christians in Egypt, who account for about 10 percent of the country's population, are the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Although they have been subjected to increasing violence in recent years, the Islamic State campaign is an alarming turn.

''As the Islamic State comes under pressure in Iraq and Syria, it has to show movement on other fronts,'' said Zack Gold, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council , an international affairs research organization. ''One of them is to demonstrate that it is still fighting a sectarian war.''

Hossam Rafaei, a lawmaker from North Sinai, said that about 90 Christian families had arrived in Ismailia. After receiving help at a church, some have been put in government housing, while others found private accommodations.

Mr. Rafaei said his constituents were in a ''state of war,'' but another lawmaker from the area, Rahmi Abd Rabbo, tried to play down the violence, claiming that no more than five families had fled from Sinai. ''It is not about being Muslim or Christian,'' he said. ''Police and military people are targeted, too.''

But fleeing Christians spoke of death lists compiled by militants and attacks in which militants had set houses on fire or burned the bodies of their victims. Many said they had no choice but to flee.

''Things were never this bad,'' said one man from El Arish, speaking by phone. ''They killed a couple of church leaders in the past, but the killings were far apart. Now we are told that are were making lists of all the Copts there.''

The man spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing for his life.

Aid workers in Ismailia estimated that at least 250 people had taken shelter in the city in churches and other safe places.

On Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi instructed his security chiefs to ''completely eradicate terrorism in northern Sinai,'' according to a statement issued by his office. But angry Copts also blamed Mr. Sisi's Egyptian security forces for failing to protect them. The security forces have been battling Islamist militants in Sinai for years.

''The state allowed hate speech to flourish, and over time that has turned into action,'' said Michel Antoune, an Evangelical church leader from Ismailia helping the refugees. ''This the natural result of state indifference.''

Earlier on Friday, Mr. Antoune helped the wife of Kamel Youssef, the plumber who had been shot dead in El Arish on Thursday. ''She broke our hearts,'' Mr. Antoune said. ''We did not know what to say to her.''

The violence against Christians could become a topic of discussion for the White House visit planned by Mr. Sisi in the coming months.

President Trump has made counterterrorism a central part of his Middle East policy. Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. Sisi, praising him as a ''fantastic guy,'' despite criticism from human rights groups about Egypt's dismal human rights record.

The Islamic State affiliate in Sinai is small compared with Iraq or Syria, but it has been increasingly active in recent weeks. It has carried out two rocket attacks on Israel in the past two weeks. There were no reported casualties, and Israel's defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said in a newspaper interview that such attacks, while ''vexing,'' did not pose a major security threat.

KABUL, Afghanistan —t least 10 police officers and the wife of a police commander were killed in an ambush by Islamic State militants in the northern province of Zawzjan, a provincial official said on Saturday.

Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the Zawzjan provincial governor, said that the police officers were ambushed Friday as they left a mosque. The wife of the police commander heard about her husband being shot and rushed to the scene, where she was also killed.

Militants linked to the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL, have been active in Afghanistan’ eastern regions, but have recently begun operating in the north of the country as well.

The Interior Ministry said in a statement that around 38 militants, including 23 Islamic State fighters, were killed in separate operations conducted by Afghan security forces in the eastern and southern regions of the country over the past two days.

Eight other militants were wounded and six were arrested in the operations, which were conducted in districts across the Nangarhar and Helmand provinces, the statement added.

In Laghman Province, in the east, two students were killed when a mortar shell struck a school classroom, a news release from the Education Ministry said. The statement said that five other students were wounded inside the classroom in Mihterlam, the province’ capital.

There were unconfirmed reports that the mortar was fired by Afghan security forces and missed its target and hit the school. The report could not immediately be verified by provincial or government officials.

Attacks on 2 Syrian Security Offices Kill Dozens

BEIRUT, Lebanon —ttacks on two Syrian security offices in the central city of Homs on Saturday killed more than 30 people, including a senior official who ran the feared military intelligence services, state media and officials reported.

An insurgent coalition linked to Al Qaeda and known as the Levant Liberation Committee claimed responsibility for the attacks, which left another high-ranking officer seriously wounded.

In a statement on its channel on the messaging app Telegram, the group said five attackers had stormed the two security offices. The group said bombs were detonated at checkpoints outside the buildings just as rescuers arrived, leading to more casualties.

The governor of Homs Province, Talal Barzani, said there were three blasts and that they killed more than 32 people. He said the attackers wore explosives and detonated them in the security offices. The two agencies are about 1.2 miles apart.

SANA, the Syrian state news agency, said Maj. Gen. Hassan Daeboul, the officer in charge of the local military intelligence branch, was killed by one of the suicide bombers.

According to state television and the state-affiliated station al-Ikhbariya, Brig. Ibrahim Darwish, the leader of the state security branch, was critically wounded in the attacks.

According to al-Ikhbariya, at least six assailants attacked the two security compounds in Homs, clashing with security officers before at least two of them detonated their explosives. It was not clear if there were any civilians among the casualties.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors the Syrian conflict from Britain with the help of local contacts, said at least 42 security officers were killed in the attacks on the offices of the state security and the military intelligence services.

The differing casualty estimates could not be immediately reconciled. Such discrepancies are not uncommon in the immediate aftermath of violence in Syria.

Homs is one of Syria’ largest cities and is largely under government control.

The attacks are among the most spectacular against security agencies in the six-year-old conflict — coordinated operation against two heavily secured government buildings using a combination of armed assaults and suicide bombings.

In the early days of the conflict, bombings directed against state security institutions were frequent, usually against military intelligence branches in Damascus and other cities. One such attack took place in July 2012, when insurgents detonated explosives inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus, killing four top government officials, including the defense minister and the brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad.

The Syrian security forces run a vast intelligence network that operates independently of the military and with little judicial oversight. Human rights groups and Syria monitors say the various branches are responsible for many crimes committed during the conflict, including torture, extrajudicial killings and the shootings of protesters.

In a February report, the human rights group Amnesty International reported that 5,000 to 13,000 people were killed in mass hangings in the military’ Saydnaya prison in Damascus between 2011 and 2015. It said the detainees were sent to the prison from around the country by the state’ four main security branches, including the military intelligence.

A Ruined Farmer and a Love Letter: Remnants From Fighting in Western Mosul

I’ in northern Iraq and spent the day traveling to the front lines of western Mosul, where Iraqi government forces are battling the Islamic State for complete control of this city. Along the way, my colleagues and I met a villager who had just escaped.

The villager, Lahib Muhammed Ali, lived on a dairy farm. He said that because the Islamic State had placed a mortar position in one of his fields, his farm was targeted in an airstrike. With tears in his eyes, he explained how the devastating blow killed 50 of his 60 cows. This cow is one of the survivors.

Further down the road we passed a large sugar factory that had been seized by the Islamic State and is now under Iraqi control.

The mood was relaxed. But then suddenly panic, as these troops heard incoming mortar fire. Their orders were to disperse. That’ when we left.

During the trip to the front lines, my colleagues, Ben C. Solomon and Muhammad Nashat Mahmud, found two letters on the ground that had been dropped from planes over the occupied parts of the city.

This one says it is from someone called Omar who is living in eastern Mosul, which was liberated by Iraqi forces in late January, and it addresses his family and others trapped in the west. He writes that those on the eastern side are safe, and he then encourages those in western Mosul to stay put and wait for the Iraqi forces to liberate their area, too.

The letter reads:

For my family and beloved people in the western side, I love you.

We are doing all right here in the eastern side, I pray God for you and ask God to bring relief to you and get liberated as soon as possible, but you have to be patient in order to get rid of these dogs, we will smash their heads. My advice to you is to stay home and do not leave it as security forces will approach you. Be cooperative with them and guide them to \b ISIS\b0  members.

I’ your son, the eastern side Omar

We are all Iraq

It is unclear how the letter got there, but there was a campaign late last year that delivered letters from civilians in liberated areas as part of an effort to persuade residents, disoriented by the terror group’ information blackout, that the Iraqi people have not forgotten them. Those letters were dropped over the ISIS-occupied area by the Iraqi forces.

The Iraqi government is advising people to stay in their homes both to avoid airstrikes or mortar fire, and in the hope that keeping civilians in western Mosul would avert the kind of destruction that was seen in Ramadi when it was liberated by government forces. But civilians in eastern Mosul paid a deadly price.

Omar signs his letter with a heart. And inside it he writes to the people of western Mosul: “ love you.”

U.S. Aid to Syrian Militia Strains Turkish Ties

SANAA, SYRIA -- A crowd of young Syrian fighters lined up behind a pickup truck to receive their equipment: an AK-47 and a load of ammunition.

The battlefield gear was their reward for completing a 20-day course led by American Special Forces in northern Syria in how to fight the Islamic State.

They will need much heavier weapons, however, if they want to evict the militants from Raqqa, the self-styled capital of the Islamic State. And facing objections from Turkey, the Trump administration has yet to say when and whether it would provide them.

This is a critical moment for the Syrian Democratic Forces, which the American military says is 50,000 strong and which it has nurtured to roll back the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.

In a war in which the United States has sought to minimize its own military footprint, this militia has become the American military's ally of choice in northern Syria and its best hope of taking Raqqa in the coming months.

But the budding alliance has drawn the United States deeper into the complex politics of northern Syria and prompted furious objections from Turkish officials.

The Syrian force includes 27,000 members of the Y.P.G, a Kurdish militia, and 23,000 local Arab fighters. Turkish officials insist that the Kurdish fighters are linked with the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is regarded as a terrorist group by both Turkey and the United States.

Hurtling across the sky in Osprey aircraft, three reporters were brought to this remote training area near Manbij by American commanders for a rare look at how some of new recruits are being trained.

The new recruits are paid $100 a month, a sum their commanders assert their families will continue to receive if they are killed or disabled in battle.

They ranged from an 18-year-old with a wispy beard to a 37-year-old from Qubissen, who said he had joined the militia after ISIS fighters killed his brother-in-law for smoking. A significant number were also women.

Of the 185 recruits who were undergoing marksmanship training on Friday, 100 are assigned to the looming Raqqa offensive while the remainder were members of the security force that is intended to protect the newly liberated town of Manbij.

American officers appear heartened there is an increasing number of recruits, but they also say that an assault against Raqqa would pit the lightly armed Syrian fighters against an enemy that is equipped with stolen Syrian tanks, antitank missiles and an abundant supply of car bombs.

''They are essentially a light, irregular formation with fairly light weapons,'' Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the American-led task force that is fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, said of the Syrian fighters. ''They are going to need additional combat power.''

To take on ISIS in its lair, American officers say the Syrian fighters will need antitank missiles, mortars, heavy machine guns and armored vehicles.

Nor is it feasible, the American officers say, to equip only Arab fighters with such weapons. American officials say that about 12,000 to 15,000 fighters will be needed to retake Raqqa, and the battle-hardened Kurds will need to be part of that fight as well.

The recent history of the campaign against ISIS certainly suggests that the Kurds have the most experience on the battlefield.

After a push by Arab fighters to take Manbij from ISIS stalled, Kurdish fighters played the critical role in wresting back control of the city in August. A top Kurdish commander, Abu Layla, was killed in the assault. Abu Amjed, the head of the Manbij Military Council, who is responsible for the defense of the city, wears a photo of the slain commander on his right arm as a memorial.

The question is whether the United States could arm Kurdish fighters without producing a violent backlash, such as a Turkish military offensive to take control of Manbij or Turkish restrictions on the use of their Incirlik Air Base by American forces.

''The Turkish government is not really crazy that we are operating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, mostly because of their Kurdish and Y.P.G. components,'' General Townsend said. But the Kurdish fighters, he added, ''tell us they are not a threat to Turkey, and I believe that.''

American military officials say there may be a way to ease Turkey's concerns.

The United States could provide the Kurdish fighters with enough weapons to seize Raqqa while restricting the flow of arms and ammunition they would receive after that battle, said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command.

''We would be transparent with them,'' General Votel said of the Turks. ''We could meter things like ammunition.''

Another argument American officers make is that because the United States and Turkey are NATO allies, Washington is in a position to look after Turkey's interests in a way other nations would not be.

''If somebody is going to have influence over the S.D.F., who would Ankara wish it to be -- Russia, Iran, the regime or the United States?'' General Townsend said.

Beyond that, the plan would also call for local Arab fighters to secure Raqqa after Kurdish and Arab fighters seized it.

As the Trump administration begins to grapple with the issues, tensions between Turkish forces in Syria and Syrian Kurds are running high.

Mr. Amjed, who commands the security force for Manbij, said that Turkish forces had been taking shots at his front lines. He insisted that he had ordered his fighters not to respond to avoid escalating the situation.

But as the fire from the marksmanship training resounded in the distance, Mr. Amjed made clear that his immediate worry was no longer ISIS.

''The biggest threat is Turkey,'' he said.

McMaster Breaks With Trump on Islam

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's newly appointed national security adviser has told his staff that Muslims who commit terrorist acts are perverting their religion, rejecting a key ideological view of other senior Trump advisers and signaling a potentially more moderate approach to the Islamic world.

The adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, told the staff of the National Security Council on Thursday, in his first ''all hands'' staff meeting, that the label ''radical Islamic terrorism'' was not helpful because terrorists are ''un-Islamic,'' according to people who were in the meeting.

That is a repudiation of the language regularly used by both the president and General McMaster's predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, who resigned last week after admitting that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about a phone call with a Russian diplomat.

It is also a sign that General McMaster, a veteran of the Iraq war known for his sense of history and independent streak, might move the council away from the ideologically charged views of Mr. Flynn, who was also a three-star Army general before retiring.

Wearing his Army uniform, General McMaster spoke to a group that has been rattled and deeply demoralized after weeks of upheaval, following a haphazard transition from the Obama administration and amid the questions about links to Russia, which swiftly engulfed Mr. Flynn.

General McMaster, several officials said, has been vocal about his views on dealing with Islamic militancy, including with Mr. Trump, who on Monday described him as ''a man of tremendous talent, tremendous experience.'' General McMaster got the job after Mr. Trump's first choice, Robert S. Harward, a retired Navy vice admiral, turned it down.

Within a day of his appointment on Monday, General McMaster was popping into offices to introduce himself to the council's professional staff members. The staff members, many of them holdovers from the Obama administration, felt viewed with suspicion by Mr. Trump's team and shut out of the policy-making process, according to current and former officials.

In his language, General McMaster is closer to the positions of former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Both took pains to separate acts of terrorism from Islamic teaching, in part because they argued that the United States needed the help of Muslim allies to hunt down terrorists.

''This is very much a repudiation of his new boss's lexicon and worldview,'' said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of ''The ISIS Apocalypse.''

''McMaster, like Obama, is someone who was in positions of leadership and thought the United States should not play into the jihadist propaganda that this is a religious war,'' Mr. McCants said.

''There is a deep hunger for McMaster's view in the interagency,'' he added, referring to the process by which the State Department, Pentagon and other agencies funnel recommendations through the National Security Council. ''The fact that he has made himself the champion of this view makes people realize they have an advocate to express dissenting opinions.''

But Mr. McCants and others cautioned that General McMaster's views would not necessarily be the final word in a White House where Mr. Trump and several of his top advisers view Islam in deeply xenophobic terms. Some aides, including the president's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have warned of a looming existential clash between Islam and the Judeo-Christian world.

Mr. Bannon and Stephen Miller, another senior adviser with anti-Islamic views, have close ties to Mr. Trump and walk-in privileges in the Oval Office. General McMaster, 54, has neither.

Known for challenging his superiors, General McMaster was nearly passed over for the rank of brigadier general in 2007, until Gen. David H. Petraeus, who used his counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq, and Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, rallied support for him.

The schisms within the administration could be aired publicly if the Senate Armed Services Committee exercises a right to hold a confirmation hearing for General McMaster. Although the post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation, senators must approve his retention of his three-star rank in a new position.

Senator John McCain, the committee's chairman and a strong supporter of General McMaster, has not said whether he wants to hold a hearing.

To outside observers, the administration's approach to the world appears increasingly schizophrenic. Mr. Pence, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior cabinet officers have reaffirmed American support for alliances with NATO and in East Asia. Mr. Bannon and other White House officials continue to suggest there will be radical shifts in American policy. These mixed messages extend beyond the Muslim world. This week, Mr. Pence traveled to Brussels to declare -- on Mr. Trump's behalf, he said -- ''the strong commitment of the United States to the continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union.''

But on Thursday, the German ambassador to the United States, Peter Wittig, said his government remains concerned that the White House views the European Union as an ailing, inefficient economic club, rather than a political project that has kept Europe at peace.

Before Mr. Pence's trip, according to Reuters, Mr. Wittig met Mr. Bannon, who told him the White House viewed the European Union as a ''flawed construct'' and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one-on-one. Mr. Wittig declined to discuss the meeting, while Mr. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.

But Mr. Wittig said to reporters, ''We will certainly fight for a coherent and resilient European Union.''

Czech Sentenced for Trying to Join  ISIS

PRAGUE -- A former mechanic from a sleepy town in the western part of the Czech Republic had never even met a Muslim when he decided last year to travel to Syria to take up arms for the Islamic State.

On Friday, the mechanic, Jan Silovsky, 22, was sentenced to three years and three months in prison for his effort to join the terrorist group, the first Czech citizen convicted on terrorism charges.

''He acted with the aim to join the Islamic State's operations and induce significant harm or death,'' said the judge, Martin Kantor.

Mr. Silovsky faced 12 years to life in prison for supporting terrorism, but psychiatrists who evaluated his mental health said he had schizoid personality disorder, which significantly lowered his ability to control his own actions.

''His intelligence is above average but his personality has developed disharmoniously and shows signs of lacking emotion, reticence, and difficulties in building relationships with other people,'' a psychiatrist, Vlastimil Tichy, told the court. Mr. Silovsky's sentence includes mandatory psychiatric treatment.

During the two-week trial, which has riveted the country, the defense team sought to portray Mr. Silovsky as a lost and mentally unstable man who had come under the influence of manipulative terrorist propaganda.

But prosecutors said that he had willingly sought to fight in the ranks of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

''He was fully aware that he would be killing people,'' said a prosecutor, Jan Kubias.

Mr. Silovsky's evolution from small-town boy to would-be terrorist began about four years ago, while he was attending vocational school. In his third year there, feeling increasingly depressed and isolated, he turned to the Bible but said that he put it aside after reading the Old Testament. He then bought a Quran.

''It appealed to me much more. I considered Islam generally better that Christianity,'' he told the court, adding that he secretly converted to the religion.

''I was not in touch with any other Muslims, in the Czech Republic or abroad,'' he said. ''Nobody knew of my conversion, not even my mother.''

His parents had divorced when he was 3, and he grew up with his mother and sister. Mr. Silovsky worked for an auto parts manufacturer after completing school.

''He worked very hard, he was always on time,'' his boss at the company told the Czech news media in August, after Mr. Silovsky was arrested.

Other people who knew him said he never smoked or drank alcohol, and would rarely talk to anyone. His mother, who appeared before the court, said she had no idea of her son's support for the Islamic State.

After converting to Islam, Mr. Silovsky began learning English and Arabic, and started to search for information about the Islamic State.

''The things they were doing didn't seem that terrible to me,'' he told the police after his arrest. ''I liked their ideology and the fact they wanted to unite the Middle East and form a single state there. I wanted to help them.''

Last February, he bought a ticket to fly from Prague to Gaziantep, Turkey, and reserved a car at a local rental agency so he could drive to the Syrian border. He wanted to reach Jarabulus, Syria, which was under ISIS control.

During a stopover in Istanbul, Turkish police officers detained him for questioning. The next day, the Turkish authorities returned him to the Czech Republic. The Czech authorities investigated him until July, when, the authorities said, he admitted that he wanted to become an ISIS fighter. At that point, he was arrested.

In his first appearance before the court this month, Mr. Silovsky said he had wanted to go to Syria but did not want to kill anyone. ''I wanted them to kill me,'' he said. When asked why he wanted to die, he said he had been suffering from anxiety, had no friends and no girlfriend, and had tried to kill himself four years ago but told no one.

However, Mr. Silovsky told had police investigators earlier that he thought he would be killing ''Syrian soldiers as well as Americans for being imperialists and Russians for killing Muslims.'' He also told the police he would have been willing to carry out executions, ''but only of those who deserve it -- murderers or drug smugglers.''

''I would shoot those people; I would certainly not cut their throats,'' he told the police.

Experts say the case has shown how Islamic State propaganda can influence vulnerable young people, even in a country with few Muslims. During four decades of Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, immigration was relatively low, and today, only about 20,000 of the Czech Republic's 10.5 million inhabitants are Muslim.

''Islam in its fundamentalist form provides simple guidelines,'' Dr. Tichy, the psychiatrist, testified at the trial. ''The way the Islamic State is presented in the media can be very appealing for such frustrated individuals, although I do think they would be disillusioned once they get there.''

Miroslav Mares, a Czech expert on terrorism, said in an interview: ''What's interesting here is that, apparently, the man had no ties with the Muslim community and is an ethnic Czech.''

''I think ISIS could have an appeal for being seen as 'pure evil,''' Mr. Mares said. ''In the 1990s, people like Silovsky might have become neo-Nazis. But today, it's groups like ISIS that seem to attract them.''

Mr. Mares said the Czech authorities, which last year introduced stricter penalties for terrorism crimes as well as new types of terror-related crimes, should also focus on media education and promote awareness of how to deal with online propaganda.

In his language, General McMaster is closer to the positions of former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Both took pains to separate acts of terrorism from Islamic teaching, in part because they argued that the United States needed the help of Muslim allies to hunt down terrorists.

“his is very much a repudiation of his new boss’ lexicon and worldview,”aid William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of “he ISIS Apocalypse.”

“cMaster, like Obama, is someone who was in positions of leadership and thought the United States should not play into the jihadist propaganda that this is a religious war,”r. McCants said.

“here is a deep hunger for McMaster’ view in the interagency,”e added, referring to the process by which the State Department, Pentagon and other agencies funnel recommendations through the National Security Council. “he fact that he has made himself the champion of this view makes people realize they have an advocate to express dissenting opinions.”

But Mr. McCants and others cautioned that General McMaster’ views would not necessarily be the final word in a White House where Mr. Trump and several of his top advisers view Islam in deeply xenophobic terms. Some aides, including the president’ chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have warned of a looming existential clash between Islam and the Judeo-Christian world.

Mr. Bannon and Stephen Miller, another senior adviser with anti-Islamic views, have close ties to Mr. Trump and walk-in privileges in the Oval Office. General McMaster, 54, has neither.

Known for challenging his superiors, General McMaster was nearly passed over for the rank of brigadier general in 2007, until Gen. David H. Petraeus, who used his counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq, and Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, rallied support for him.

The schisms within the administration could be aired publicly if the Senate Armed Services Committee exercises a right to hold a confirmation hearing for General McMaster. Although the post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation, senators must approve his retention of his three-star rank in a new position.

Senator John McCain, the committee’ chairman and a strong supporter of General McMaster, has not said whether he wants to hold a hearing.

To outside observers, the administration’ approach to the world appears increasingly schizophrenic. Mr. Pence, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior cabinet officers have reaffirmed American support for alliances with NATO and in East Asia. Mr. Bannon and other White House officials continue to suggest there will be radical shifts in American policy. These mixed messages extend beyond the Muslim world. This week, Mr. Pence traveled to Brussels to declare —n Mr. Trump’ behalf, he said —“he strong commitment of the United States to the continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union.”

But on Thursday, the German ambassador to the United States, Peter Wittig, said his government remains concerned that the White House views the European Union as an ailing, inefficient economic club, rather than a political project that has kept Europe at peace.

Before Mr. Pence’ trip, according to Reuters, Mr. Wittig met Mr. Bannon, who told him the White House viewed the European Union as a “lawed construct”nd preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one-on-one. Mr. Wittig declined to discuss the meeting, while Mr. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.

But Mr. Wittig said to reporters, “e will certainly fight for a coherent and resilient European Union.”

Iraqi Forces Capture Most of Mosul Airport

MOSUL, Iraq -- Iraqi forces seized most of Mosul's airport on Thursday, an important milestone in the broader offensive to retake the western half of the country's second-largest city from the Islamic State, Iraqi and allied officials said.

The push to take the airport, which has been led by the Iraqi federal police, is a promising start to what is expected to be a difficult and bloody fight to completely evict the Islamic State from the city.

''They are most of the way through the airfield,'' Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Isler, a senior United States Air Force officer in the American-led headquarters in Baghdad, said late Thursday afternoon.

It took Iraqi forces 100 days to seize the eastern half of the city, an operation that led to significant Iraqi casualties. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, who arrived in Baghdad on Thursday, said about 500 Iraqi military personnel had been killed and about 3,000 had been wounded in that operation.

After taking the eastern portion of the city, Iraqi forces paused for three weeks to form a strategy to reclaim the western half without enduring such punishing attrition.

They decided to resume their offensive by taking the rest of the city on multiple axes so that the Islamic State would find it difficult to coordinate its defenses.

''They are ahead of schedule of where we thought they would be,'' said Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan of New Zealand, who is a senior officer in the American-led international coalition here.

The renewed Iraqi offensive was preceded by a week of powerful American-led airstrikes, during which 158 bombs were dropped on 33 targets, including the headquarters from which commanders of the Islamic State, also know as ISIS or ISIL, were believed to be operating. Among the other targets were places where the militants assembled car bombs.

The Islamic State first conquered the city in 2014, but it has consistently lost ground in recent months to Iraqi forces backed by coalition air support.

One bombing attack was directed at a five-story building in Al Jumhuri medical complex in western Mosul that an American official said had been turned into an Islamic State command center. Militants often use hospitals, schools and religious buildings in the hopes that coalition forces will be reluctant to bomb them. In this instance, American officials said they had determined that no civilians were present.

In another move to buttress the Iraqis, American advisers have been operating closer to the fighting and at lower levels of the Iraqi chain of command.

Iraqi forces have been attacking with a three-pronged approach. Moving south to north, Iraq's federal police took Abu Saif, a town that sits on high ground overseeing the Mosul airport, before moving on to the airfield itself.

To the west of the federal police, Iraq's counterterrorism service, the country's premier fighting force, has been moving north toward the former Ghazlani military base. All 14 of the counterterrorism service's fighting battalions have been committed to the Mosul fight, a spokesman for the force said.

Farther west still is the Iraqi Army's Ninth Division, a tank unit.

American and allied planes, including F-15E Strike Eagles, AV-8B Harriers and French warplanes, have provided close air support for the Iraqis. The Americans have used armed drones, and American Army Apache attack helicopters have also fired Hellfire missiles to help the Iraqis advance.

Shiite militias, officially known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have moved to cut off the routes to Mosul and are operating west of the city. The Americans have not been carrying out airstrikes to support these fighters, many of whom are backed by Iran. Instead, Iraqi F-16s and attack helicopters have been carrying out strikes in this area.

The battle for the old part of western Mosul, with its many narrow and winding streets, is expected to be difficult. Armored vehicles cannot maneuver in such close quarters. Much of the fighting will need to be done by Iraqi troops fighting house to house in a section of the city that is still home to an estimated 750,000 civilians.

The precise number of Islamic State fighters in Mosul is not clear, though some military officials estimated there were 4,000 to 6,000 militants there.

The runways in the Mosul airport have been heavily damaged by the Islamic State to prevent Iraq and its allies from ferrying in troops and supplies.

Satellite images of the airport published by the geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor show wide trenches cutting across the runways and piles of rubble positioned to create a barrier. Even adjacent taxiways and aprons, where planes typically park, have been destroyed.

Still, the airport and the Ghazlani base are important terrain and sit astride the southern approach to the old part of the city.

The advancing troops began their approach in snaking rows of Humvees across the bald hills at first light, moving in meandering patterns across rocky terrain. Soldiers with belt-fed weapons and M-19 grenade launchers sat atop them as they approached the airfield.

Capt. Abdulhadi Ahmed of Iraq's counterterrorism unit said that Islamic State snipers had taken up positions in the air traffic control towers.

''ISIS bodies were mixed with the rubble all over the place,'' Maj. Abdulsalam Aljibouri said. ''We noticed that many ISIS fighters had taken off their vests and helmets to escape the airport faster.''

When the Iraqi troops finally got onto the runway, some of them broke out in celebratory songs, but some said they could not help being saddened by the sight.

''We were happy for the victory, but sad for the level of destruction of such an important airport,'' Captain Ahmed said.

 ISIS  Hates Our Saint Because He Belongs to Everyone; Op-Ed Contributor

LONDON —ast Thursday a suicide bomber affiliated with the so-called Islamic State attacked Sehwan Sharif, one of the most revered Sufi shrines, in the southern Sindh Province of Pakistan, killing more than 80 people, including 24 children, and wounding more than 250.

Why the terrorists hate Sehwan is why we love it. The saint and his shrine at Sehwan belong to everyone, to Sunnis and Shiites, to Hindus and Muslims, transgender devotees, to believers and questioners alike. The inclusiveness, the rituals and music born of syncretic roots make shrines like Sehwan Sharif targets in the extremist interpretations of the Islamic State and other radical Wahhabi militants.

As a child in the late 1980s and early ’0s, I would visit the town of Sehwan with my family on our way from Karachi to Larkana, my family’ hometown. After driving along bumpy roads deserted but for palm trees and solitary men standing on the open highways selling lotus flower seeds, we would stop near the western bank of the Indus River to visit the shrine of Sehwan’ patron saint, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a 13th-century Persian mystic and poet who was a contemporary of Rumi.

Qalandar, whose real name was Syed Mohammad Usman Marwandi, is adored in music and poetry as the Red Falcon. As you drive through the narrow, dusty streets of Sehwan, the air becomes perfumed with the scent of roses, sold in small plastic bags and body-length garlands that devotees lay at his tomb.

I was 7 when I first saw Sehwan during Ashura, when Shiites mourn the Prophet Muhammad’ grandson Hussain, who was killed in 680 by an unjust ruler at Karbala, in what is now Iraq.

I remember thousands of men and women together in collective, ritualized mourning in the courtyard of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar’ shrine. They walked barefoot over glass and the embers of burning cigarette butts, their black shalwar kameez drenched in sweat, their palms striking their chests rhythmically. Even as a 7-year-old, I found something hypnotic, something fierce, something pure about Sehwan.

Over the years, I kept returning to Sehwan to sit in that courtyard, the shrine illuminated by red and green fairy lights, its golden dome and turquoise minarets soaring above a town of modest roofs.

The cool tiled floor of the shrine is often carpeted with devotees, some carrying tiffins of food on outings with their children, others in fraying and torn shalwar kameez prostrate in prayer. Even wealthy urbanites visit to lay their anxieties at the feet of the buried saint, tiptoeing gingerly through the crowds. In a country built and maintained on immovable divisions of ethnicity, gender, class and belief, the shrine at Sehwan welcomed all. It was an egalitarian oasis formed by the legacies and practice of Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism merging into one.

On Thursday evenings people congregate to listen to the religious songs called qawwali and perform a devotional dance, dhamal. They arrive with offerings of bruised rose petals, sugared almonds and what money they can spare. They seek solace from their pain; pray for safety in a harsh, unjust world; beg for an answer to a forgotten prayer. Those who can’ offer anything arrive empty-handed. Sehwan’ shrine promised the weak, the worried and the poor that they would always be safe here.

Every time we visited the shrine, a deaf and mute man named Goonga welcomed my brother, Zulfi, and me. A servant and a guardian of the shrine, Goonga wore his hair in a turban and had a matted beard. On the breast pocket of his shalwar kameez, he sometimes wore a picture of Hussain. Goonga would walk us through the shrine that was his home and refuge.

In the courtyard of the shrine, men in flowing robes and long dreadlocks sing:

[Video: Shahbaz Qalandar - Qawwali journey to Sehwan Sharif with Fanna-Fi-Allah Watch on YouTube.]

O laal meri pat rakhio bala Jhoole Laalan, Sindhri da Sehwan da, sakhi Shahbaaz Qalandar, Dama dam mast Qalandar,

which translates to:

O red-robed, protect me always, Jhule Lal, Friend of Sindh, of Sehwan, God-intoxicated Qalandar, Every breath intoxicated by you, Qalandar.

No matter how far from Sehwan I have traveled, how far from lands where Urdu is spoken and heard, just to hear “ama dam mast Qalandar”s to be transported home.

My brother called me after the attack on the shrine. “oonga,”e asked. “s he alive?”e were trying to find out. But no one had seen Goonga since the blast. We Pakistanis always believed our saints protected us. In Karachi, where we live by the sea, we believe that the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi, overlooking the Arabian Sea shore, saved the city from cyclones and tsunamis.

Before Qalandar arrived here, before Islam came to the subcontinent, Sehwan was known as Shivistan after the Hindu god Shiva. In time, the town’ name was changed, but Sindh has long remained a home to all faiths. At the annual festival of Qalandar, a Hindu and a Muslim family together drape a ceremonial cloth over Qalandar’ grave. A lamp-lighting ceremony reminiscent of Hindu rites is also performed.

The shrine in Sehwan was attacked because it belongs to an open, inclusive tradition that some in Pakistan would rather forget than honor. Though it was founded as a sanctuary for Muslims, in its early incarnation, Pakistan was a home for all those who wished to claim it. Parsis, Sikhs, Christians and Jews remained in Pakistan after the bloody Partition in 1947.

Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Pakistan’ brutal military dictator in the 1980s, aided by Saudi money and supported by the United States, destroyed Pakistan’ progressive, syncretic culture. In the 11 years that General Zia presided over Pakistan, our textbooks were rewritten, exclusionary, intolerant laws were passed, and primacy was given to the bearers of a closed, violent worldview. Pakistan never recovered. Only pockets of the country still imbibe the generous welcome once afforded to all faiths. Sehwan is one of them.

After the attack, Pakistan’ military closed the border with Afghanistan and complained that the attackers had been given haven in Afghanistan. In retaliation, 100 people accused of being terrorists have been killed by the military.

Sehwan has no proper hospital, no trauma centers. For all its historical, religious and cultural significance, it was —ike so much of this wounded country —bandoned by those who rule the province. There is no real governance here, no justice and no order. For life’ basic necessities, people must supplicate themselves before dead saints.

On the morning after the blast, the caretaker rang the bell, just as he always had. Devotees broke through the police cordons and returned to dance the dhamal on Saturday. Zulfi texted, “oonga is alive.”

On my last visit to the shrine, after Goonga walked me through the crowded marketplace selling food and offerings, I sat on the floor besides a mother who had brought her son, crippled with polio, in the hopes that her prayers would ease his suffering. I had come to the shrine to see the blue and white floral kashi tiles, to walk around the perimeter and to be in a part of Pakistan that still operated on that rarest of currencies: hope.

Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•hite House rescinds bathroom access rules.

The administration reversed an Obama-era policy that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, an order that caused a rift in President Trump’ cabinet.

The “athroom debate”itted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has opposed expanding gay and transgender rights, against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who initially objected to the decision.

Ms. DeVos said in a statement Wednesday night that she considered it a “oral obligation”or every school in America to protect students from discrimination, bullying and harassment.

•n exciting discovery, not so far away.

Not one, but seven Earth-size planets have been discovered orbiting a tiny star about 40 light-years away (not terribly far in cosmic terms). Some of them might even be awash in water.

It’ the first realistic opportunity for scientists to find evidence of alien life.

•onservative Political Action Conference is underway.

The four-day gathering will be in full steam outside Washington today, and Vice President Mike Pence will give an address at 7:30 p.m. The president is scheduled to speak on Friday.

Some conservatives attending the conference question whether Mr. Trump will be loyal to their agenda.

•esting U.S.- Mexico ties.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson arrived in Mexico on Wednesday for meetings that will help the country decide whether to battle or to appease the Trump administration.

Separately, Speaker Paul D. Ryan made a quick visit to a border town in Texas where a promised wall could rise. The increased threat of deportation has sent many immigrants into hiding.

•orth Dakota protest camp disperses.

The deadline for Dakota Access pipeline protesters to clear their largest camp passed Wednesday afternoon. Ten people were arrested, but 25 to 50 demonstrators are thought to remain.

Here’ a 360 view of what’ left of the camp.

• ould-be bomber’ recruitment, and his foiled plan.

Documents obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act show how the so-called underwear bomber was inspired to try to blow up a plane as it approached Detroit in 2009.

Business

• former Uber engineer detailed in a recent blog post a history of discrimination and sexual harassment at the company.

Her revelations shined light on a workplace culture in the technology sector that can be aggressive and unfriendly to women.

•he U.S. economy appears to be avoiding a winter swoon, which means the Federal Reserve could raise its benchmark interest rate “airly soon,”inutes of a recent meeting show.

• secret bank account is at the heart of a federal racketeering lawsuit brought by tobacco farmers. They say they were swindled out of $24 million by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

•.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Here’ a snapshot of global markets.

Smarter Living

•n Tuesday, we talked about forgiving yourself for getting off track with your New Year’ resolution. And we asked what caused your slip-up.

Many who wrote said they had lapsed because of one of two things: not having enough time, or life getting in the way.

Here are some stories that might help you with time management, learning to be less busy, finding time to exercise, eating better in restaurants, avoiding sugar in everyday life, rethinking work/life balance and learning to “monotask.”

We’l be back on Monday to wrap up resolutions month.

•ecipe of the day: A classic baked, cheesy pasta can be improved by broccoli, a little spice and a sheet pan.

Noteworthy

• geopolitical whodunit.

The very public killing of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader, has grown into a bizarre mystery.

It involves an ever-expanding cast of characters, including women from Vietnam and Indonesia accused of carrying out the attack with toxic liquid smeared on their hands, and other suspects believed to be North Korean agents.

Pyongyang  accused Malaysia of fabricating evidence.

•n inside look at a city torn apart by ISIS.

Last month, the Iraqi government recovered the eastern part of Mosul in a victory against the Islamic State. Our reporter takes you inside what remains.

Today’ episode of The Daily podcast looks at the next chapter of the offensive. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device.

•merica’ aging dams.

Recent crises in Oroville, Calif., and Elko County, Nev., have put the spotlight on the nation’ ailing infrastructure. As of 2015, there were nearly 2,000 high-hazard dams in need of repair.

•est of late-night TV.

On “he Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon introduced a new party game, “wo truths and an alternative fact.”ther hosts poked fun at Republican members of Congress besieged by their constituents at town halls.

Back Story

In New Orleans, the annual party leading up to Mardi Gras will be in full swing in the coming days, culminating next week on Fat Tuesday.

Among the highlights are parades by social clubs known as krewes. Riding on lavishly decorated floats, krewe members toss beads, plastic cups, coins and other “hrows”o revelers lining a route that usually runs for several miles.

Tonight’ parades include the Krewe of Muses, an all-female organization named after the goddesses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology. (Nine of New Orleans’ streets —ncluding Calliope, Melpomene and Terpsichore —ere inspired by the daughters of Zeus.)

Muses is one of the city’ newer krewes, parading for the first time in 2001. (Rex, one of the oldest, was founded in 1872.) Like many krewes, Muses is involved in charitable efforts in the community, but it is particularly known for the ornate shoes it throws —r gently hands —o the crowds.

Its floats, including one resembling a giant high-heel shoe, often have a satirical theme; this year’ is Dr. Meuss on the Loose, a play on Dr. Seuss.

And unlike other krewes, it does not have a king or queen. Instead, the group has an Honorary Muse. This year, it’ the journalist Tamron Hall.

Chris Stanford contributed reporting.

LONDON -- They called him Abu Zakariya al-Britani -- the surname means ''the Briton'' -- and they say he blew himself up on Monday in an attack at a village southwest of Mosul, Iraq.

The claim, in a communiquérom the Islamic State, immediately revived fears about foreign fighters who have moved to Syria or Iraq to join the group's ranks. But in Britain, it prompted even more troubling allegations.

Several British news organizations -- including the BBC, The Times of London and The Guardian -- reported Tuesday evening that the man was Jamal Malik al-Harith, a native of Manchester, England, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001; detained by the United States in the military prison at Guantáamo Bay, Cuba, from 2002 to 2004; and released to Britain, where the government later awarded him 1 million pounds, about $1.25 million at current exchange rates, to settle a lawsuit.

The possibility that a former Guantáamo inmate had gone to Iraq to blow himself up stirred outrage in British tabloids. It also prompted an emphatic response on Wednesday from Tony Blair, a former prime minister of Britain whose decision to join President George W. Bush in invading Iraq in 2003 remains divisive. Mr. Blair said in a statement that he was being unfairly blamed for the Americans' release of Mr. Harith to Britain, even though it was widely supported at the time.

''It is correct that Jamal al-Harith was released from Guantáamo Bay at the request of the British government in 2004,'' Mr. Blair said. ''This followed a massive media and parliamentary campaign, led by The Daily Mail, the very paper that is now supposedly so outraged at his release, and strongly supported by the then-Conservative opposition.''

Mr. Blair added that the compensation was agreed to in 2010 by the government of the Conservative prime minister at the time, David Cameron.

''The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took,'' Mr. Blair said.

''The reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations,'' he added, referring to Mr. Harith and other Britons who had been held at Guantáamo.

Mr. Blair did not say he knew for certain that Mr. Harith was the man who carried out the bombing claimed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. His comments were limited to pushing back against criticisms of Mr. Harith's release.

The Islamic State released a photograph of a militant it said was the bomber. The Times of London quoted a man named Leon Jameson as saying that the person in the photograph was his brother, Mr. Harith. ''It is him, I can tell by his smile,'' Mr. Jameson said. ''If it is true, then I've lost a brother.''

However, neither American nor British officials verified that the militant was Mr. Harith, who was also known as Ronald Fiddler.

''There is no independent confirmation of the identity of this man who is believed to be dead in Mosul,'' the prime minister's office said in a statement.

Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement: ''I can confirm that an individual named Jamal Malik al-Harith was detained in the Guantáamo Bay detention facility from February 2002 to March 2004, when he was released to the United Kingdom. However, we cannot confirm his death, as the occurrence of the same name does not necessarily equate to this being the same individual.''

According to Defense Department documents, Mr. Harith was born in 1966 in Manchester. He was detained by the Taliban in Pakistan, and then held by the Taliban in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was detained by American forces in October 2001.

He was transferred to Guantáamo Bay in February 2002. That September, Maj. Gen. Michael E. Dunlavey, who was in charge of intelligence operations at Guantáamo, recommended that Mr. Harith be approved for release or transfer, based on an assessment that he ''was not affiliated with Al Qaeda or a Taliban leader.''

Nonetheless, Pentagon officials had their doubts about the man. They noted that he had traveled extensively in the Middle East from 1992 to 1996, and that he had joined a Qaeda operative who went to Sudan in 1992 at the same time that Osama bin Laden was active there. The recommendation that he be released was overruled by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the commander of the Guantáamo operation from November 2002 to March 2004.

However, the case of Mr. Harith and several other British citizens held at Guantáamo became divisive, and the British government -- then led by Mr. Blair -- helped secure their release.

On Wednesday, Alex Carlile, a lawyer and member of the House of Lords who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in Britain from 2001 to 2011, explained the reasons for the financial settlement with Mr. Harith. He said that the settlement ''should not have been necessary,'' but that if the government had not made the payment, it would have had to disclose national security secrets.

Mr. Carlile said it was disturbing that the government did not appear to have knowledge or control of Mr. Harith's movements after he returned to Britain. ''It's a quandary,'' he said. ''It is absolutely plain and clear that he had significant radical associates.''

He added: ''He was in this country, and he was able to leave and fight for ISIL, and that raises questions on border checks. That said, he had lain low, so attention was put on people who were more active.''

A number of Britons have gone off to fight for the Islamic State. Perhaps the most prominent was Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed Jihadi John, who was killed in a November 2015 airstrike near Raqqa, Syria. Mr. Emwazi was shown in videos in late 2014 and early 2015 killing several American and other Western hostages.

According to the Islamic State communiqué the fighter who went by the name Britani blew himself up in a car bomb on Monday during an attack on the Iraqi Army and allied militias in the village of Tal Kisum, southwest of Mosul. It was not clear if others were wounded or killed.

In a related attack, an Iraqi militant detonated a car bomb targeting a Russian-made tank in the area, according to the memo.

The Islamic State says this photograph, released by the group's media arm, shows Abu Zakariya al-Britani, a suicide bomber. (PHOTOGRAPH BY NINAWA STATE, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS)

No Relief as Media Obsesses on Trump

I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn't read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president.

What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an ''Oprah Winfrey Show'' tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder.

It wasn't my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours), but shifted most of my energy to looking for Trump-free zones.

My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no Trump-free part of the press.

But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else.

President Trump is inescapable.

The new president doesn't simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow.

Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be Trump-soaked, and averted my eyes as I scrolled for non-Trump news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for subject-specific sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable; when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.)

Even when I found non-Trump news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts.

It wasn't just news. Mr. Trump's presence looms over much more. There he is off in the wings of ''The Bachelor'' and even ''The Big Bang Theory,'' whose creator, Chuck Lorre, has taken to inserting anti-Trump messages in the closing credits. Want to watch an awards show? Say the Grammys or the Golden Globes? Trump Trump Trump. How about sports? Yeah, no. The president's policies are an animating force in the N.B.A. He was the subtext of the Super Bowl: both the game and the commercials, and maybe even the halftime show.

Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon.com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife's Valentine's Day present. (I bought her jewelry.)

Trump's fame may break all records.

All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It's possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past -- say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler -- dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now.

I'm hedging because there isn't data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence.

Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures ''earned media,'' which is all coverage that isn't paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising.

In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant's records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company's chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama's monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July.

It's not just that Mr. Trump's coverage beats anyone else's. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1,000 of the world's best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million), Kim Kardashian ($36 million), and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million), all the way down to the 1,000th most-mentioned celebrity in mediaQuant's database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1,001).

The coverage those 1,000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori's preliminary figures.

How do we know Mr. Trump is more talked about than anyone else in the past? There are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before. Facebook estimates that about 3.2 billion people have internet connections. On average, the people of Earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media, according to the marketing research firm Zenith. So almost by definition, anyone who dominates today's media is going to be read about, talked about and watched by more people than ever before.

''From a media perspective, it's pretty clear,'' Mr. Senatori said. ''The sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he's off the charts.''

But shouldn't we all be thinking about Trump?

Mr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there's an argument that our tech-fueled modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what's called for.

On most days, Mr. Trump is 90 percent of the news on my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and probably yours, too. But he's not 90 percent of what's important in the world. During my break from Trump news, I found rich coverage veins that aren't getting social play. ISIS is retreating across Iraq and Syria. Brazil seems on the verge of chaos. A large ice shelf in Antarctica is close to full break. Scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near Australia.

There's a reason you aren't seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike old-school media, today's media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable.

Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of ''inequality'' in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Watts's music-downloading site were shown just the titles and band name of each song. The other half were also shown a social signal -- how many times each song had been downloaded by other users.

Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes; when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular.

I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It's not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals -- likes, retweets and more -- are amplifying it.

Every new story prompts outrage, which puts the stories higher in your feed, which prompts more coverage, which encourages more talk, and on and on. We saw this effect before Mr. Trump came on the scene -- it's why you know about Cecil the lion and Harambe the gorilla -- but he has accelerated the trend. He is the Harambe of politics, the undisputed king of all media.

The volume isn't sustainable.

It's only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone -- reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news -- has been amped up to 11.

For now, this might be all right. It's important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening.

But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it's probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long.

In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today's newspapers are also full of non-Trump articles, but many of us aren't reading newspapers anymore. We're reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else.

There's no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he's not everything -- and it'd be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.

More U.S. Troops May Be Needed Against  ISIS  in Syria, Central Command Says

AMMAN, Jordan -- More American troops may be needed in Syria to speed the campaign against the Islamic State, the top United States commander for the Middle East said on Wednesday.

''I am very concerned about maintaining momentum,'' Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, told reporters accompanying him on a trip to the region.

''It could be that we take on a larger burden ourselves,'' he added. ''That's an option.''

The current American strategy is to press the Islamic State from multiple directions by moving ahead with the offensive to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa even as Iraqi forces carry on their operation to take western Mosul.

Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters backed by the United States are to play the principal role in seizing Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State's professed caliphate.

But one option being considered is for American troops to step up their support of the fighters by firing artillery, shooting mortars, helping with logistics and significantly expanding efforts to advise them, much as the United States is doing for Iraqi forces in the battle for Mosul.

In late January, President Trump gave the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, 30 days to develop a ''preliminary plan'' to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. That deadline is fast approaching.

Mr. Trump has not said what steps he is prepared to take to make good on his campaign vow to hasten the defeat of the Islamic State. But he has a high regard for American generals and for Mr. Mattis, and he is likely to be receptive to their recommendations.

General Votel's trip to the region and a visit Mr. Mattis recently made to Iraq are intended to help the Pentagon refine the plan that is presented to the White House.

The United States has about 500 Special Operations troops in Syria. If the American military presence were to be expanded, additional personnel could come from conventional combat units, though General Votel stressed that he would not recommend deploying large combat formations.

''We want to bring the right capabilities forward,'' he said. ''Not all of those are necessarily resident in the Special Operations community. If we need additional artillery or things like that, I want to be able to bring those forward to augment our operations.''

Raqqa has long been an objective for the American-led campaign. In addition to serving as the Islamic State's capital, it has been a sanctuary for militants who have plotted to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe.

But the mission to seize Raqqa has been seriously complicated by Turkey's vociferous objections to any effort by the United States to arm the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish militia in northern Syria known by its Kurdish initials, Y.P.G.

American military officers have said that the Y.P.G. is the most capable Syrian fighting force and the best hope for mounting an attack to capture Raqqa in the coming weeks. To conduct urban warfare, however, the group needs to be equipped with armored vehicles, heavy machine guns and other arms.

Turkey, however, has denounced the Y.P.G. as a terrorist group. The United States ambassador in Ankara, American officials say, has cautioned that proceeding with the plan to arm the Kurdish group could prompt a major Turkish backlash, which could ultimately undermine American military efforts in Syria.

After months of sharp debate within his administration, President Barack Obama concluded during his final week in office that the United States should arm the Y.P.G., former administration officials said. But Mr. Obama left the ultimate decision to the Trump administration, which had informed his national security adviser that it wanted to conduct its own review of military strategy.

Many observers say that if arming the Y.P.G. is ruled out, it could take a long time to cobble together an alternative force that could draw on Turkish-backed Syrian militias and other fighters. How effective that force might be is unclear. The Turkish military and the Syrian fighters it backs have had a difficult time trying to seize the northern town of Al Bab from the Islamic State even though American teams have been inserted with Turkish units to call in American airstrikes.

General Votel did not detail how the United States might proceed if the White House ruled out equipping the Y.P.G. in deference to Turkish concerns. But he asserted there were several ways to keep up the pressure against Raqqa, including making greater use of American troops.

''We might bring potentially more of our assets to bear if we need to, as opposed to relying on our partners,'' he said. ''That's an option.''

''There could be other forces that we potentially bring in to do this,'' General Votel added. ''It could be a different approach to how we go after the city in terms of changing our tactics.''

Toward the end of his administration, Mr. Obama approved the use of three Apache attack helicopters to support the Raqqa offensive. Expanding the use of Apaches, which have yet to be deployed in Syria, could be an option as well, observers say.

What has been successful ''for us in the campaign thus far, I think, has been simultaneous pressure on the Islamic State and continuing to present them with lots of dilemmas,'' General Votel said.

Danes Fighting for  ISIS  Got Welfare Benefits

The Danish government has been inadvertently paying benefits to citizens fighting for the Islamic State in Syria, Danish officials said Tuesday, as outrage grows that militants are manipulating the country's generous welfare system.

About 145 Danes have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight for militant groups since 2012, according to the Danish security and intelligence services.

Officials said this week that they had identified a number of Danish citizens who, while receiving government disability pensions, had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

''It is a huge scandal that we are paying out money from the welfare funds in Denmark to people who are going to Syria and elsewhere in the world to undermine democracy that we have been fighting for for hundreds of years,'' the country's minister of labor, Troels Lund Poulsen, said.

Last year, the news media reported that more than two dozen Danish citizens receiving unemployment benefits had traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS, even though the law requires recipients to live in Denmark.

Senior labor ministry officials said Tuesday that the center-right government of Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was planning to pass legislation to plug loopholes and prevent what they called an egregious misuse of public funds.

Officials said that since last year, municipal and state authorities had been trying to collect about $95,000 in welfare benefits that had been wrongly paid to 29 citizens who had gone to Syria to fight for ISIS.

Until now, national regulations have made it difficult for the authorities to stop benefit payments to a suspected militant, even if the person had been identified by the intelligence services as an ISIS fighter. Officials said investigating the circumstances of individuals in Syria or Iraq was logistically challenging.

Under the proposed legislation, any citizen deemed a national security risk after traveling abroad to join the Islamic State would have his or her benefits immediately halted, said Bent Nielsen, an official who oversees how welfare benefits are distributed.

''If someone is deemed to be a risk for state security by intelligence services while staying abroad, they wouldn't get a dime,'' Mr. Nielsen said. He added that, under the proposed legislation, once a Danish court determines that a citizen has violated the law and joined the Islamic State, then Danish authorities could also demand the reimbursement of benefits already paid.

Dozens of militants have returned to Denmark after fighting for ISIS in the Middle East, and the country has been experimenting with ways to reintegrate the former fighters, including psychological counseling, education and job advice.

More than a decade ago, Denmark became a flash point for Islamic extremism after a Danish newspaper published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, spurring outrage and protests across the Muslim world. In February 2015, Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a 22-year-old Danish-born gunman of Palestinian descent, killed two people while targeting a Copenhagen synagogue and an event promoting free speech. He was later shot dead by police.

The efforts to tame Islamic radicalism in Denmark are occurring against the backdrop of a simmering culture war over Danish identity and the challenge of integrating immigrants, which has helped drive support for the far-right anti-immigrant Danish People's Party.

This month, the Parliament approved a statement by the Danish People's Party expressing concern that there were more immigrants than native-born Danes in some areas of Copenhagen.

''Parliament notes with concern that today there are areas in Denmark where the share of immigrants and descendants from non-Western countries surpasses 50 percent,'' the statement said. ''It is the opinion of the Parliament that Danes should not be a minority in neighborhoods in Denmark.'' The statement, which was largely symbolic but generated a loud debate, also called for the government to limit the granting of asylum.

Opponents of the statement, which was supported by the government and its coalition partners and passed by a vote of 55-54, said it stigmatized Danish immigrants and citizens who were born of immigrant parents.

The Danish People's Party also caused an outcry after its immigration spokesman, Martin Henriksen, suggested that Muslim refugees and immigrants should celebrate Christian festivals, including Christmas and Easter, if they wanted to be accepted as Danish.

Also this month, another far-right, anti-immigrant group, the Party of the Danes, came under criticism after stuffing immigrants' mailboxes in a suburb west of Copenhagen with fliers that looked like one-way airline tickets. The party is not in the Danish Parliament.

The fake airline tickets showed a flight from Copenhagen to ''Langbortistan,'' which roughly translates to ''Faraway-istan.'' The tickets also included a message in Arabic: ''Have a good trip home.''

The Norrebro neighborhood of Copenhagen represents the struggle to maintain Danish identity while integrating immigrants. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ILVY NJIOKIKTJIEN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

 ISIS  Says British Militant Carried Out Suicide Attack in Iraq

LONDON —hey called him Abu Zakariya al-Britani —he surname means “he Briton”—nd they say he blew himself up on Monday in an attack at a village southwest of Mosul, Iraq.

The claim, in a communiquérom the Islamic State, immediately revived fears about foreign fighters who have moved to Syria or Iraq to join the group’ ranks. But in Britain, it prompted even more troubling allegations.

Several British news organizations —ncluding the BBC, The Times of London and The Guardian —eported Tuesday evening that the man was Jamal Malik al-Harith, a native of Manchester, England, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001; detained by the United States in the military prison at Guantáamo Bay, Cuba, from 2002 to 2004; and released to Britain, where the government later awarded him 1 million pounds, about $1.25 million at current exchange rates, to settle a lawsuit.

The possibility that a former Guantáamo inmate had gone to Iraq to blow himself up stirred outrage in British tabloids. It also prompted an emphatic response on Wednesday from Tony Blair, a former prime minister of Britain whose decision to join President George W. Bush in invading Iraq in 2003 remains divisive. Mr. Blair said in a statement that he was being unfairly blamed for the Americans’elease of Mr. Harith to Britain, even though it was widely supported at the time.

“t is correct that Jamal al-Harith was released from Guantáamo Bay at the request of the British government in 2004,”r. Blair said. “his followed a massive media and parliamentary campaign, led by The Daily Mail, the very paper that is now supposedly so outraged at his release, and strongly supported by the then-Conservative opposition.”

Mr. Blair added that the compensation was agreed to in 2010 by the government of the Conservative prime minister at the time, David Cameron.

“he fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took,”r. Blair said.

“he reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations,”e added, referring to Mr. Harith and other Britons who had been held at Guantáamo.

Mr. Blair did not say he knew for certain that Mr. Harith was the man who carried out the bombing claimed by the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL. His comments were limited to pushing back against criticisms of Mr. Harith’ release.

The Islamic State released a photograph of a militant it said was the bomber. The Times of London quoted a man named Leon Jameson as saying that the person in the photograph was his brother, Mr. Harith. “t is him, I can tell by his smile,”r. Jameson said. “f it is true, then I’e lost a brother.”

However, neither American nor British officials verified that the militant was Mr. Harith, who was also known as Ronald Fiddler.

“here is no independent confirmation of the identity of this man who is believed to be dead in Mosul,”he prime minister’ office said in a statement.

Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement: “ can confirm that an individual named Jamal Malik al-Harith was detained in the Guantáamo Bay detention facility from February 2002 to March 2004, when he was released to the United Kingdom. However, we cannot confirm his death, as the occurrence of the same name does not necessarily equate to this being the same individual.”

According to Defense Department documents, Mr. Harith was born in 1966 in Manchester. He was detained by the Taliban in Pakistan, and then held by the Taliban in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was detained by American forces in October 2001.

He was transferred to Guantáamo Bay in February 2002. That September, Maj. Gen. Michael E. Dunlavey, who was in charge of intelligence operations at Guantáamo, recommended that Mr. Harith be approved for release or transfer, based on an assessment that he “as not affiliated with Al Qaeda or a Taliban leader.”

Nonetheless, Pentagon officials had their doubts about the man. They noted that he had traveled extensively in the Middle East from 1992 to 1996, and that he had joined a Qaeda operative who went to Sudan in 1992 at the same time that Osama bin Laden was active there. The recommendation that he be released was overruled by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the commander of the Guantáamo operation from November 2002 to March 2004.

However, the case of Mr. Harith and several other British citizens held at Guantáamo became divisive, and the British government —hen led by Mr. Blair —elped secure their release.

On Wednesday, Alex Carlile, a lawyer and member of the House of Lords who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in Britain from 2001 to 2011, explained the reasons for the financial settlement with Mr. Harith. He said that the settlement “hould not have been necessary,”ut that if the government had not made the payment, it would have had to disclose national security secrets.

Mr. Carlile said it was disturbing that the government did not appear to have knowledge or control of Mr. Harith’ movements after he returned to Britain. “t’ a quandary,”e said. “t is absolutely plain and clear that he had significant radical associates.”

He added: “e was in this country, and he was able to leave and fight for ISIL, and that raises questions on border checks. That said, he had lain low, so attention was put on people who were more active.”

A number of Britons have gone off to fight for the Islamic State. Perhaps the most prominent was Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed Jihadi John, who was killed  in a November 2015 airstrike near Raqqa, Syria. Mr. Emwazi was shown in videos in late 2014 and early 2015 killing several American and other Western hostages.

According to the Islamic State communiqué the fighter who went by the name Britani blew himself up in a car bomb on Monday during an attack on the Iraqi Army and allied militias in the village of Tal Kisum, southwest of Mosul. It was not clear if others were wounded or killed.

In a related attack, an Iraqi militant detonated a car bomb targeting a Russian-made tank in the area, according to the memo.

I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Here’ What I Learned.; State of the Art

I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn’ read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president.

What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an “Oprah Winfrey Show”ape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder.

It wasn’ my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours), but shifted most of my energy to looking for Trump-free zones.

My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no Trump-free part of the press.

But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else.

President Trump is inescapable.

The new president doesn’ simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow.

Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be Trump-soaked, and averted my eyes as I scrolled for non-Trump news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for subject-specific sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable; when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.)

Even when I found non-Trump news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts.

It wasn’ just news. Mr. Trump’ presence looms over much more. There he is off in the wings of “The Bachelor”nd even “The Big Bang Theory,”hose creator, Chuck Lorre, has taken to inserting anti-Trump messages in the closing credits. Want to watch an awards show? Say the Grammys or the Golden Globes? TrumpTrumpTrump. How about sports? Yeah, no. The president’ policies are an animating force in the N.B.A. He was the subtext of the Super Bowl: both the game and the commercials, and maybe even the halftime show.

Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon.com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife’ Valentine’ Day present. (I bought her jewelry.)

Trump’ fame may break all records.

All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It’ possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past —ay, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler —ominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now.

I’ hedging because there isn’ data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence.

Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures “arned media,”hich is all coverage that isn’ paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising.

In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant’ records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company’ chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama’ monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July.

It’ not just that Mr. Trump’ coverage beats anyone else’. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1,000 of the world’ best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million), Kim Kardashian ($36 million), and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million), all the way down to the 1,000th most-mentioned celebrity in mediaQuant’ database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1,001).

The coverage those 1,000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori’ preliminary figures.

How do we know Mr. Trump is more talked about than anyone else in the past? There are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before. Facebook estimates that about 3.2 billion people have internet connections. On average, the people of Earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media, according to the marketing research firm Zenith. So almost by definition, anyone who dominates today’ media is going to be read about, talked about and watched by more people than ever before.

“rom a media perspective, it’ pretty clear,”r. Senatori said. “he sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he’ off the charts.”

But shouldn’ we all be thinking about Trump?

Mr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there’ an argument that our tech-fueled modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what’ called for.

On most days, Mr. Trump is 90 percent of the news on my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and probably yours, too. But he’ not 90 percent of what’ important in the world. During my break from Trump news, I found rich coverage veins that aren’ getting social play. ISISis retreating across Iraq and Syria. Brazil seems on the verge of chaos. A large ice shelf in Antarctica is close to full break. Scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near Australia.

There’ a reason you aren’ seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike old-school media, today’ media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable.

Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of “nequality” in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Watts’ music-downloading site were shown just the titles and band name of each song. The other half were also shown a social signal —ow many times each song had been downloaded by other users.

Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes; when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular.

I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It’ not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals —ikes, retweets and more —re amplifying it.

Every new story prompts outrage, which puts the stories higher in your feed, which prompts more coverage, which encourages more talk, and on and on. We saw this effect before Mr. Trump came on the scene —it’ why you know about Cecil the lion and Harambe the gorilla —ut he has accelerated the trend. He is the Harambe of politics, the undisputed king of all media.

The volume isn’ sustainable.

It’ only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone —eporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news —as been amped up to 11.

For now, this might be all right. It’ important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening.

But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it’ probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long.

In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today’ newspapers are also full of non-Trump articles, but many of us aren’ reading newspapers anymore. We’e reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else.

There’ no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he’ not everything —nd it’ be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.

British Militant Carried Out Suicide Attack in Iraq,  ISIS  Says

LONDON —hey called him Abu Zakariya al-Britani —he surname means “he Briton”—nd they say he blew himself up on Monday in an attack at a village southwest of Mosul, Iraq.

The claim, in a communiquérom the Islamic State, immediately revived fears about foreign fighters who have moved to Syria or Iraq to join the group’ ranks. But in Britain, it prompted even more troubling allegations.

Several British news organizations —ncluding the BBC, The Times of London and The Guardian —eported Tuesday evening that the man was Jamal Malik al-Harith, a native of Manchester, England, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001; detained by the United States in the military prison at Guantáamo Bay, Cuba, from 2002 to 2004; and released to Britain, where the government later awarded him 1 million pounds, about $1.25 million at current exchange rates, to settle a lawsuit.

The possibility that a former Guantáamo inmate had gone to Iraq to blow himself up stirred outrage in British tabloids. It also prompted an emphatic response on Wednesday from Tony Blair, a former prime minister of Britain whose decision to join President George W. Bush in invading Iraq in 2003 remains divisive. Mr. Blair said in a statement that he was being unfairly blamed for the Americans’elease of Mr. Harith to Britain, even though it was widely supported at the time.

“t is correct that Jamal al-Harith was released from Guantáamo Bay at the request of the British government in 2004,”r. Blair said. “his followed a massive media and parliamentary campaign, led by The Daily Mail, the very paper that is now supposedly so outraged at his release, and strongly supported by the then-Conservative opposition.”

Mr. Blair added that the compensation was agreed to in 2010 by the government of the Conservative prime minister at the time, David Cameron.

“he fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took,”r. Blair said. “he reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations.”

Mr. Blair did not say he knew for certain that Mr. Harith was the man who carried out the bombing claimed by the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL. His comments were limited to pushing back against criticisms of Mr. Harith’ release.

The Times of London quoted a man named Leon Jameson as saying that the militant in a photograph distributed by the Islamic State was his brother, Mr. Harith. “t is him, I can tell by his smile,”r. Jameson said. “f it is true, then I’e lost a brother.”

However, neither American nor British officials could say for certain that the militant was Mr. Harith, who was also known as Ronald Fiddler.

“s all U.K. consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas,”he Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement.

Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement: “ can confirm that an individual named Jamal Malik al-Harith was detained in the Guantáamo Bay detention facility from February 2002 to March 2004, when he was released to the United Kingdom. However, we cannot confirm his death, as the occurrence of the same name does not necessarily equate to this being the same individual.”

According to Defense Department documents, Mr. Harith was born in 1966 in Manchesterd. He was detained by the Taliban while driving in Pakistan, and he was then held by the Taliban in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was detained by American forces in October 2001.

He was transferred to Guantáamo Bay in February 2002. That September, Maj. Gen. Michael E. Dunlavey, who was in charge of intelligence operations at Guantáamo, recommended that Mr. Harith be approved for release or transfer, based on an assessment that he “as not affiliated with Al Qaeda or a Taliban leader.”

Nonetheless, Pentagon officials had their doubts about the man. They noted that he had traveled extensively in the Middle East from 1992 to 1996, and that he had joined a Qaeda operative who went to Sudan in 1992 at the same time that Osama bin Laden was active there. The recommendation that he be released was overruled by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the commander of the Guantáamo operation from November 2002 to March 2004.

However, the case of Mr. Harith and several other British citizens held at Guantáamo became divisive, and the British government —hen led by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who supported President George W. Bush’ decision to go to war with Iraq —elped secure their release.

On Wednesday, Alex Carlile, a lawyer and member of the House of Lords who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in Britain from 2001 to 2011, explained the reasons for the financial settlement with Mr. Harith.

He said the settlement “hould not have been necessary,”ut that if the government had not made the payment, it would have had to disclose national security secrets.

Mr. Carlile said it was disturbing that the government did not appear to have knowledge or control of Mr. Harith’ movements after he returned to Britain.

“t’ a quandary,”e said. “t is absolutely plain and clear that he had significant radical associates.”

He added: “e was in this country, and he was able to leave and fight for ISIL, and that raises questions on border checks. That said, he had lain low, so attention was put on people who were more active.”

A number of Britons have gone off to fight for the Islamic State. Perhaps the most prominent was Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed Jihadi John, who was killed  in a November 2015 airstrike near Raqqa, Syria.

In Caribbean, Racing to Foil Flow to Jihad

ENTERPRISE, Trinidad and Tobago -- By the time he was 17, Fahyim Sabur had memorized the Quran.

At 23, he was shunning calypso parties and giving private Arabic lessons in his neighborhood here in Enterprise, about 20 miles south of Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago.

A year later, he was on the battlefield in Syria, where he died fighting for the Islamic State.

''He never spoke to me about it,'' said his father, Abdus Sabur, 56, who sells meat patties on the street. ''National Security called me one day and told me, 'Your son is dead.' ''

Law enforcement officials in Trinidad and Tobago, a small Caribbean island nation off the coast of Venezuela, are scrambling to close a pipeline that has sent a steady stream of young Muslims to Syria, where they have taken up arms for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

American officials worry about having a breeding ground for extremists so close to the United States, fearing that Trinidadian fighters could return from the Middle East and attack American diplomatic and oil installations in Trinidad, or even take a three-and-a-half-hour flight to Miami.

President Trump spoke by telephone over the weekend with Prime Minister Keith Rowley of Trinidad and Tobago about terrorism and other security challenges, including foreign fighters, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said.

Trinidad has a history of Islamist extremism -- a radical Muslim group was responsible for a failed coup in 1990 that lasted six days, and in 2012 a Trinidadian man was sentenced to life in prison for his role in a plot to blow up Kennedy International Airport. Muslims make up only about 6 percent of the population, and the combatants often come from the margins of society, some of them on the run from criminal charges.

They saw few opportunities in an oil-rich nation whose economy has declined with the price of petroleum, experts say. Some were gang members who either converted or were radicalized in prison, while others have been swayed by local imams who studied in the Middle East, according to Muslim leaders and American officials.

The young men found solace in radical Islamist websites and social media.

And in the call to jihad.

In contrast to the laws of many countries, it is not illegal in Trinidad to join the so-called caliphate, though the government wants to change that. One hundred to 130 people have made the trip to Syria from Trinidad, which has a population of 1.3 million, according to a former United States ambassador, John L. Estrada, and Trinidad's minister of national security, Edmund Dillon.

By comparison, about 250 citizens of the United States, a country with 240 times the population, had joined the extremists or attempted to travel to Syria by late 2015, according to a House Homeland Security Committee report.

Per capita, Trinidad has the greatest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the Islamic State, said Mr. Estrada, who stepped down after the inauguration of President Trump last month.

''Trinidadians do very well with ISIL,'' Mr. Estrada said. ''They are high up in the ranks, they are very respected and they are English-speaking. ISIL have used them for propaganda to spread their message through the Caribbean.''

Much of the information about the identities of those who went abroad comes from American intelligence sources, although local imams and Islamic leaders all said they knew several people, including women, who had left.

''I know whole families that went,'' said Imtiaz Mohammed, president of the Islamic Missionaries Guild, which does charity work in Trinidad and the Middle East.

Juan S. Gonzalez, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said the bulk of Islamic State fighters from Latin America originated in Trinidad and Tobago. The numbers underscore a risk of lone-wolf attacks in the region, he added.

''As the United States continues to corner ISIS and defeat them, a lot of these guys aren't going to feel they have safe quarters,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''Is the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, prepared for these guys to return back to their countries? This is a real vulnerability.''

He noted that people in the Caribbean enjoyed visa-free travel throughout the islands, which makes it fairly easy to travel to the Bahamas, and from there make a ''short jump'' to South Florida.

The United States, which encouraged Trinidad to tighten its laws, has hosted meetings with Muslim leaders at the embassy in Port of Spain, and paid for several to attend anti-extremism workshops in the United States.

Mr. Sabur, the young radical from Enterprise, is one of a handful of Trinidadians known to have died in Syria. Others include Shawn Parson, who appeared in an Islamic State recruiting video. He was targeted by an F.B.I. program that, with the cooperation of the military, sought to eliminate the group's social media figures, often with drone strikes.

Last summer, Shane Crawford, also known as Abu Sa'd at-Trinidadi, perhaps Trinidad's best-known Islamic State recruit, was prominently featured in an article in the group's magazine, Dabiq, in which he called for attacks on Western embassies.

Mr. Crawford said he had been influenced by Islamic lectures and a Trinidadian Muslim leader, Ashmead Choate. Mr. Choate ''attained martyrdom'' in Ramadi, Iraq, the article said.

The genesis of today's rising militancy, Mr. Crawford added in the article, can be traced to the failed 1990 coup, when a group of radical Muslims took legislators hostage in a siege of Parliament. When it was over, two dozen people were dead.

Yasin Abu Bakr, 76, who led that uprising and has since been released from prison, said the government had created a climate where young Muslims did not feel safe or welcome in the military or civil service. ''This is total discrimination and isolation against young Muslims in Trinidad,'' he said in an interview.

Trinidad's attorney general, Faris Al-Rawi, said that after the coup, wearing Muslim garb ''took on a certain appeal.''

''A lot of people who were not genuinely Muslim or otherwise took on the persona to carry on their thuggery,'' he added.

Mr. Al-Rawi said Mr. Crawford was believed to have died in Syria. His mother, Joan Crawford, said she had heard rumors that he had been badly wounded.

Ms. Crawford, 62, said that her son had been falsely accused of plotting to kill the Trinidadian prime minister, and that this had diminished his professional prospects, even though he ran a fish business and had experience in plumbing.

''Once you are branded a terrorist in your own country, what could you do?'' said Ms. Crawford, a former Spiritual Baptist who converted to Islam after her son did. ''I did cry, because I knew I would never see him again. I did not get to say goodbye.''

Efforts to combat the flow of young Muslims to overseas battlefields have been complicated by the ambivalence toward, and sometimes support for, the jihadi cause among some imams and the recruits' parents. In an interview that began and ended with a prayer, Mr. Sabur said he had welcomed his son's death as a martyr: ''I felt elated. Speaking about it now, I am overelated.''

The Trinidadian government last week introduced a series of amendments that would criminalize membership in the Islamic State and other extremist organizations. People who traveled to certain regions would be presumed to be doing so for terrorism, and the burden to prove otherwise would be on them, Mr. Al-Rawi said.

Mr. Mohammed, of the Islamic Missionaries Guild, criticized the proposed legislation, saying groups like his that make trips to the Middle East are often engaged in charity work and could be unfairly singled out.

''You can't just go to a court and have a judge tell you that you are guilty with no evidence, just an assumption,'' he said.

Mr. Mohammed has publicly denounced the Islamic State, but noted that his own United States visa and commercial pilot's license had been revoked after a terrorism suspect passed through his Islamic center.

A senior intelligence official in Trinidad who was not authorized to speak publicly said he worried that the proposed legislation would make people who would have left for Syria plan attacks at home instead.

He said about 15 or 20 of the Islamic State recruits spent two weeks before their trips at a mosque in Rio Claro, about 50 miles southeast of Port of Spain. There, they attended an orientation, the official said.

Umar Abdullah, an Islamic activist, said he had been among those who encouraged the would-be fighters.

Despite having made thinly veiled threats to Americans in the past, which led a cruise ship on its way to Trinidad to turn back, Mr. Abdullah has since denounced extremism, and now says Muslims must work with the United States to ''change the narrative.'' It would be ''stupid'' to try to attack the United States Embassy, he said.

''At one point in time I was a strong believer in that, and I still believe it to some extent,'' Mr. Abdullah said. ''But to do something like that would put the Muslim community in harm's way. We would not be able to stand the fallout of that type of action.''

The imam in Rio Claro, Nazim Mohammed, denied running an Islamic State training program, and insisted that he operated an elementary school and a weekly food program for the poor. But he acknowledged that two of his children and five of his grandchildren were in Syria, and that the adults were believed to be involved with the Islamic State.

''Killing and murdering is not Islamic,'' Nazim Mohammed, 75, said in an interview. ''Our program is to help people. You know how many people have come here for help?''

He insisted that his children did not notify him of their plans, and he shrugged off the group's influence.

''Who is ISIS?'' he said. ''ISIS is just a few people.''

World; Europe
Danes Fighting for  ISIS  Were Paid Welfare Benefits, Government Says

The Danish government has been inadvertently paying benefits to citizens fighting for the Islamic State in Syria, Danish officials said Tuesday, as outrage grows that militants are manipulating the country’ famously generous welfare system.

About 145 Danes have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight for militant groups since 2012, according to the Danish security and intelligence services. Officials said this week that they had identified a number of citizens who, while receiving government disability pensions, had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0 .

“t is huge scandal that we are paying out money from the welfare funds in Denmark  to people who are going to Syria and elsewhere in the world to undermine democracy that we have been fighting for hundreds of years,”he country’ minister of labor, Troels Lund Poulsen , said.

Last year, the news media reported that more than two dozen Danish citizens receiving unemployment benefits had traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS, even though the law requires recipients to live in Denmark.

Senior labor ministry officials said Tuesday that the center-right government of Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen  was planning to pass legislation to plug loopholes and prevent what they called an egregious misuse of public funds.

Officials said that since last year, municipal and state authorities had been trying to collect about $95,000 in welfare benefits that had been wrongly paid to 29 citizens who had gone to Syria to fight for ISIS.

Until now, national regulations have made it difficult for the authorities to stop benefit payments to a suspected militant, even if the person had been identified by the intelligence services as an ISIS fighter. Officials said investigating the circumstances of individuals in Syria or Iraq was logistically challenging.

Under the proposed legislation, any citizen deemed a national security risk after traveling abroad to join a militant group would have their benefits immediately halted, said Bent Nielsen, an official who oversees how welfare benefits are distributed.

“f someone is deemed to be a risk for state security by intelligence services while staying abroad, they wouldn’ get a dime,”r. Nielsen said. He added that, under the proposed legislation, once a Danish court determines that a citizen has violated the law and joined the Islamic State, then Danish authorities would also be able to demand the reimbursement of benefits already paid.

Dozens of militants have returned to Denmark after fighting for ISIS in the Middle East, and the country has been experimenting with ways to reintegrate the former fighters, including psychological counseling, education and job advice.

More than a decade ago, Denmark became a flash point for Islamic extremism after a Danish newspaper published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, spurring outrage and protests across the Muslim world. In February 2015, Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein , a 22-year-old Danish-born gunman of Palestinian  descent, killed two people while targeting a Copenhagen synagogue and an event promoting free speech. He was later shot dead by police.

The efforts to tame Islamic radicalism in Denmark comes against the backdrop of a simmering culture war in the country over Danish identity and the challenge of integrating immigrants, which has helped drive support for the far-right anti-immigrant Danish People’ Party.

Earlier this month, the Parliament approved a statement by the Danish People’ Party expressing concern that there were more immigrants than native-born Danes in some areas of Copenhagen.

“Parliament notes with concern that today there are areas in Denmark where the share of immigrants and descendants from non-Western countries surpasses 50 percent,”he statement said. “t is the opinion of the parliament that Danes should not be a minority in neighborhoods in Denmark.”he statement, which was largely symbolic but generated a loud debate, goes on to call for the government to limit the granting of asylum.

Opponents of the statement, which was supported by the government and its coalition partners and passed by a vote of 55-54, said it stigmatized Danish immigrants and citizens who were born of immigrant parents.

The Danish People’ Party also caused an outcry after its immigration spokesman, Martin Henriksen, suggested that Muslim refugees and immigrants should celebrate Christian festivals, including Christmas and Easter, if they wanted to be accepted as Danish .

Also earlier this month, another far-right, anti-immigrant group, the Party of the Danes, came under criticism  after stuffing immigrants’ailboxes in a suburb west of Copenhagen with fliers that looked like one-way airline tickets. The party is not in the Danish Parliament.

The fake airline tickets showed a flight from Copenhagen to “angbortistan,”hich roughly translates to “araway-istan.”he tickets also included a message in Arabic: “ave a good trip home.”

Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•rump appoints new national security adviser.

President Trump announced on Monday that Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster would be his new national security adviser, replacing Michael T. Flynn, who was asked to resign after he misled officials about contacts with Russia’ ambassador.

General McMaster is widely respected and is credited with helping to turn around the Iraq war.

His selection followed a report in The Times about two of Mr. Trump’ associates working on a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia. They have no experience in foreign policy, and their “iplomatic freelancing”nfuriated Ukrainian officials.

•aking on a foe of political unity.

If East Stratcom sounds like a group tasked with devising plans to win wars, that’ not far-off. The 11-member team is serving as Europe’ front line against fake news.

Separately, Mr. Trump  claimed that Sweden was experiencing a crisis because of immigration. During a rally over the weekend, he suggested that a terrorist attack had occurred there the night before. Swedish officials were baffled.

•umpy recess for Congress.

Some lawmakers are holding town hall-style meetings with their constituents over the break, providing a testing ground of political divisions.

The events, which have been contentious at times during discussions of the Affordable Care Act, may signal how much latitude voters will give to defenders of the president.

Our reporters will be covering four town hall meetings today, including one by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.

•reeding ground for ISIS.

Trinidad and Tobago is scrambling to stop young Muslims from going to Syria to take up arms for the Islamic State.

Per capita, the Caribbean island nation has the largest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the militant group, the former U.S. ambassador there said.

Back Story

Today the U.N. is celebrating International Mother Language Day. Started in 2000, it is a day to celebrate linguistic diversity and draw attention to endangered and defunct languages.

An event 65 years ago this week was the inspiration. Students in Dhaka —hen the capital of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh —emanded that the government designate Bengali as an official language. Violence broke out, and the police opened fire on the demonstrators, killing at least six, according to an article in The Times in 1952.

There are around 3,000 endangered languages, some of them dialects, according to an estimate by the U.N.’ cultural body, Unesco. Extinction occurs when the last known speaker dies. That was the case when Alban Michael, a speaker of a dialect of Nuu-chah-nulth in British Columbia, Canada, died last year. Vancouver Island, where Mr. Michael lived, is particularly rich in dialects.

Multilingual education is the focus of International Mother Language Day this year. “ducation and information in the mother language is absolutely essential to improving learning and developing confidence and self-esteem,”he director-general of Unesco said.

A Twitter post last week by Unesco was even more emphatic: “Languages are who we are. Protecting this identity is a matter of human rights!”

Palko Karasz and Sandra E. Garcia contributed reporting.

Colbert and Meyers Take On Trump’ Media Attacks

Most late-night hosts took Presidents’ay off. But Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers observed the holiday by taking some shots at President Trump —articularly his suggestion that the news media is an enemy of the American people.

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

“ou know who I feel bad for? ISIS. They try so hard. Sorry, ISIS, if you want to get on the list, publish photos of Trump’ inauguration crowd. Then he’l be really angry at you.”—OLBERT

“ swear to do everything in my power to protect the nation from America’ enemies —hich I’ being told are CBS and the failing New York Times. Wow, things have really changed since I was in the Army five minutes ago.”—OLBERT, impersonating H. R. McMaster, the recently appointed national security adviser

“enator John McCaincriticized President Trump’ attack on the media yesterday and said that stifling the press is how dictators get started. Said Trump: ‘ool, and then what do they do next?’holds up imaginary notepad]”—EYERS

[Video: “ven just getting into an airplane now is a suspenseful experience under Trump,”r. Meyers said of reports that the president did not consult his secretary of state on his decision to back off the two-state solution. Watch on YouTube.]

The Meatloaf Diet

Mr. Meyers also couldn’ help feasting on the news that Mr. Trump had insisted that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former surrogate of the Trump campaign, order the meatloaf when they recently dined together.

“f course, the meatloaf was actually a second course for Christie after Trump made him swallow his pride.”—EYERS

A Bit Worth Watching

'We're Not in Iraq to Seize Anybody's Oil,' Mattis Says

BAGHDAD -- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, on the first visit by a senior Trump administration official to Iraq, worked on Monday to repair breaches of trust with Iraq's leaders caused by his boss just as the two sides began a major offensive to oust the Islamic State from its last stronghold in the country.

Mr. Mattis found himself in nearly the same position he was in during his just-finished trip to Europe, where much of his time was spent reassuring wary allies that the United States was still committed to NATO after statements and actions by President Trump seemed to call old alliances into question.

Before arriving in Baghdad, Mr. Mattis was asked by reporters about Mr. Trump's remarks during a visit to C.I.A. headquarters last month that the United States should have ''kept'' Iraq's oil after the American-led invasion, and might still have a chance to do so.

''We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil,'' Mr. Mattis said during a stop in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

Mr. Mattis also found himself allaying concerns that the administration would exclude from the United States Iraqis who have worked and fought side by side with American troops.

Mr. Trump's initial executive order shutting the door to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries included Iraq. That order has been stayed by the courts and is expected to be replaced soon.

Mr. Mattis said on Sunday that he had not seen the new executive order. ''But right now,'' he said, ''I'm assured that we will take steps to allow those who have fought alongside us to be allowed into the United States.''

His remarks came as Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of the United States' war effort in Iraq, said that American trainers and advisers had moved closer to the front lines of Mosul, where the fight to retake the western half of the city from the Islamic State started over the weekend.

''It is true that we're operating closer and deeper into Iraqi formations,'' General Townsend said at a news conference with Mr. Mattis in Baghdad, acknowledging a shift approved in the Obama administration's final weeks.

While Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements have unsettled allies around the world, they have landed especially hard in Iraq, where about 5,000 American troops are assisting Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

A former Iraqi ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, said last month that Iraqis were unsettled by Mr. Trump's moves, including the travel ban, and wondered whether the United States even wanted a long-term relationship with Iraq.

On Monday, American and Iraqi officials did their best to put forward a united front at a time when a critical battle against the Islamic State is intensifying.

Mr. Mattis, after meeting with his Iraqi counterpart and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, said the militant Sunni group's days were numbered. ''They are going to be shown to be who they are, which is a bunch of murderous relics,'' he said.

Sabeh Al Noman, a spokesman for Iraq's counterterrorism services, suggested that Mr. Trump's remarks on oil, at least, had caused no lasting damage. Asked in a news conference in Baghdad whether Iraq was worried that the Trump administration would try to steal its oil, he said, ''We will trust your government, so we won't worry about that.''

Apache helicopter gunships as well as American and other allied artillery are set to strike Islamic State targets in and around western Mosul, as they have for weeks in the fight to reclaim what was once Iraq's second-largest city, officials said.

American commanders estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 Islamic State fighters remain hunkered down in western Mosul.

''Some are hard-core and will stand and fight and die in place, some will want to escape, some will attempt to quietly quit the fight, and some will sympathize with the enemy but are not now participating,'' Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Baghdad, said in an email. ''And then, unfortunately, some will be pressed into the fight under threat of death and other harsh retribution.''

Mr. Trump has asked the Pentagon to present a plan for accelerating the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

While defense officials have yet to present him with new options, many Pentagon officials have been operating under the assumption that Mr. Trump will be more willing than President Barack Obama to sign off on having American troops closer to the battlefield.

Yet it was in the final weeks of Mr. Obama's presidency that the move closer to the front lines was put in place, as Iraqi security forces began their push to retake eastern Mosul from the Islamic State.

When Mr. Obama authorized sending the first group of American trainers and advisers back to Iraq in 2014, he said he did not want them getting close to the fight, insisting that it be an Iraqi-led effort. With the exception of raids by Special Forces, American troops had largely stayed off the battlefield, embedded with Iraqi officers at the brigade level.

That changed in November, United States military officials said Monday, when the administration allowed American trainers and advisers to move closer to the battlefield for the Mosul operation.

The change, military officials said, will allow for quicker response times, particularly when it comes to calling in airstrikes.

Ever since the start of United States-led airstrikes against the Islamic State, in August 2014, American pilots have complained that depending on Iraqi troops to call in airstrikes makes for slow response times.

Now, two years into the war against the Islamic State and in the middle of the fight to retake Mosul, American commanders said on Monday that operations were speeding up. For one thing, they said, the Iraqi ground troops are now much sharper.

Recently, ''one American commander said, 'I'm watching an army that I know is Iraqi, but if I step back, I wouldn't know they were not American,' '' said Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Isler, the deputy commander in charge of coordinating air support for the Iraqi ground forces.

But the fight for western Mosul is expected to be intense. Since capturing the city, Islamic State fighters ''have had two years to prepare'' for the coming assault, said Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan of New Zealand, one of the commanders of the American-led coalition in Iraq. ''There are some very elaborate defenses in West Mosul.''

Over the weekend, airplanes dropped leaflets in West Mosul appealing to Islamic State fighters to surrender.

While in Baghdad, Mr. Mattis plans to talk with Iraqi officials as well as American military commanders. ''I need to get current on the situation'' in Iraq, he said. ''And the only way you can do this is talking to the people on the ground.''

He said that although power had been transferred in Washington, the rules of engagement in Iraq had not changed, and American Special Forces would not get closer to the fighting in western Mosul than they had in eastern Mosul, which had largely been cleared of militant control.

''The U.S. forces continue in the same role as they did in East Mosul,'' Mr. Mattis said, adding that coalition forces fighting the Islamic State would ''continue with the accelerated effort'' to destroy the group.

Gail Collins: Frank, it’ so exciting to take a break from Donald Trump and converse about —ovies! Although I truly believe that almost everything about the Academy Awards this year will be political.

Frank Bruni: That is a bit of unimpeachable soothsaying, Gail. I’ suggest that the drinking game for this year’ Oscars is a quaff every time there’ a reference, explicit or oblique, to our 45th president, but I fear I’ be blamed —ightly —or a national cirrhosis epidemic.

Gail: Well, I definitely blame/credit our president with the fact that I’e seen all nine best picture nominees. Once they went above five, I gave up the challenge. But right now I’l do anything to divert my mind from the White House.

Frank: Maybe in this conversation we should analyze every movie through the lens of Trump, because it seems to me right now that all of American life is discussed through the lens of Trump. He’ an all-consuming lens. Like some Hubble telescope of commanders in chief.

Gail: That’ quite the image. I’ now imagining the lovers in “a La Land”oing to Griffith Observatory to look through —onald Trump? Euew. Although if “a La Land”s named best picture, it’l probably be because the president made everyone desperate for cheer.

I did think it was a good movie, despite the part about Ryan Gosling showing the black guys how to really play jazz. Did you have an artistic/political favorite?

Frank: “oonlight”ll the way. I agree with you on “a La Land”— good movie and a definite agent of cheer —ut worthy of the boatload of Oscars that everyone’ predicting for it? No.

“oonlight,”hough, is something of a miracle: Its protagonist is inarticulate —e barely has any dialogue —ut the movie couldn’ be more articulate. Or more engrossing.

Gail: You’e right. “oonlight”s great. “a La Land”s entertaining.

Frank: By being so quiet and so deliberate, “oonlight”nvests the most intimate moments — single conversation, a single touch —ith the sweep and resonance that they can and do actually have in a life.

And I think it’ the perfect companion piece for this political moment. Our campaigns and debates reduce race to an abstraction, but “oonlight,”ithout ever explicitly identifying race as one of its concerns, gives us a view of disadvantaged, troubled black lives that’ intensely relatable and mostly (though not entirely) free of cliché It has an authority and a dignity that bowled me over.

Gail: I’e seen a lot of fine movies about poverty and race, but I don’ think I’e ever seen one that kept its audience without violence or even, for the most part, sex. Just knocked me out.

Frank: Take me through the best picture nominees and tell me which is a Trump movie, which a Hillary Clinton movie, which a Bernie Sanders movie, and which a Ted Cruz movie. Let’ reunite the whole 2016 gang!

Gail: “idden Figures”s definitely the Hillary movie. It’ not fancy, but it wins you over with the determination of its heroines. Plus there are some scenes about getting to the restroom I know she’ appreciate.

In theory “ences”hould be the Bernie Sanders movie, since everybody in it keeps making the same long speeches. Am I being too mean? To Bernie, that is.

Frank: I want to say that “acksaw Ridge”s a Trump movie, in that it’ so damned blunt and bullying, and there’ more than a whiff of Trump in its director, Mel Gibson, whom Hollywood seems to have forgiven utterly. (The only thing Hollywood does better than sermonize and browbeat is forgive.)

But it’ about someone who’ the opposite of a bully: a pacifist in a war zone. Sort of like Jeb Bush in the 2016 campaign.

Gail: “ell or High Water”s about brothers who are about to lose the family ranch. So you can weave in some Sanders populism. The Texas Ranger is played by Beloved Actor Jeff Bridges, who will be our stand-in for Joe Biden. Hardly anybody remembers this movie is up, so that’l give us a Martin O’alley.

Frank: “rrival”s a Kellyanne Conway movie, in that cutting through the fog of her spin is precisely like trying to communicate with an alien.

Gail: I liked “anchester by the Sea,”ut since it’ the most depressing movie in memory, I’ have to say that its political parallel is election night.

Unless you’e got a yen to discuss “ion,”et’ move on to the acting categories. Is there anybody you’e really dying to see win? Who’ give the craziest acceptance speech?

Frank: If Meryl Streep somehow won best actress, which she won’, we’ get something juicy and political, because she’ deep into her juicy and political phase now, though I suspect she’ leave football out of it this time around.

I’ love to see a win by Isabelle Huppert for “lle,” movie that I found mesmerizing in part because its feminist politics, for lack of a better phrase, were so impossible to parse. I’l tell you this: If you made that exact same script with that exact same director but set it in San Francisco and put Sharon Stone in the lead, women would be picketing it. You buy yourself a lot of wiggle room with a French accent, subtitles, a Parisian locale, the Seine, a few baguettes and Huppert.

Gail: Too bad we’e not still doing the political comparisons, since “lle”alls to mind the adjectives “ark and twisted.”

I’ rooting for Mahershala Ali to win best supporting actor for “oonlight.”

Frank: I find the supporting categories more exciting this year than the lead ones, which have nominees I seriously question: Ryan Gosling in “a La Land,”uth Negga in “oving,”treep in “lorence Foster Jenkins.”treep is the best of those three, but she’ had so many nominations at this point that when she’ anything short of transcendent, the nod seems obligatory, compulsory, predictable —ike a Trump brag about his Electoral College haul whenever he utters more than 10 sentences in public.

Gail: Sometimes you have supporting nominees who actually seemed to be the lead in the movie —hinking here of Dev Patel, the star of “ion,”o matter what the list-makers say. He can be our stand-in for Mike Pence, who I suspect is going to wind up as the real chief executive while Trump just …oars.

And then there are the ones who make brief, spectacular appearances, like Michelle Williams in “anchester.”ut Ali was very low-key as the fatherly drug dealer. And he wasn’ onscreen long, yet he made a huge impact —eally set the tone for the whole film.

Frank: The supporting actress category marks the first time three of the five nominees in an acting category are black. It also happens to be, in my view, the strongest field of the four acting categories.

In any other year, Williams —pectacular indeed —ould win. But this year Naomie Harris (“oonlight” and Viola Davis (“ences” are up, too, and they’e spectacular.

Gail: All the actors in “ences”ere top-notch, but I sort of lost track of their quality in the fog of all that talk.

Frank: Yeah, “ences”as so clearly a stage production in cinematic drag, talky and inert in a way that rarely works onscreen. But there’ still no denying the artistry of Davis’ work in it or the fact that she’ due an Oscar. The trophy will go to her.

Are there categories beyond the acting ones that you find interesting, especially at this fraught juncture in our country’ existence?

Gail: Yes, I’ dying to see who’l pick up the award for best foreign film, if “he Salesman”rom Iran wins. The director, as you know, was barred from the country during the Trump immigration crackdown.

The real drama is going to be in those acceptance speeches. How many of the honorees will take the time to thank their co-stars and agents before going directly to the horrificness of Donald Trump?

Frank: That depends, really, on how much more horrificness Trump will yet commit. There’ —hat? — week until the little gold men are doled out. That’ plenty of time for our big gold man to ban Hindus, levy special tariffs on Delta (poor, scapegoated Delta), fire two more senior aides and divulge his top-secret strategy for fighting ISIS (um, whatever happened to that?) over s’ores on the beach in front of Mar-a-Loco. Sorry, Mar-a-Lago.

Gail: Well, it should be …n evening. And you know the president will be watching every minute.

Frank: I await the morning-after tweets. And for a reality check, may I say that I never imagined a day when I’ be expecting angry post-Oscar tweets from the president of the United States? Someday this will be a movie. I cannot wait, because it will mean that we’e finally past this fearful present.

A Washington Post reporter who brought to light a video of Donald J. Trump making lewd comments about women and a ProPublica reporter who covered the Trump campaign's growing traction with voters in a tumultuous election year were among the winners of the George Polk Awards in Journalism for 2016, announced on Sunday.

''We've seen fake news, trite news, disinformation campaigns and charges of biased coverage,'' said John Darnton, the curator of the Polk Awards.

But in a nod to this year's Polk winners, Mr. Darnton said there were also bright spots. ''A vibrant press continues to inform, expose, tell the truth and occasionally fill us all with outrage at injustice,'' he said.

Journalists representing a dozen news organizations were recognized in 14 categories in the awards, which are administered by Long Island University in honor of George Polk, a CBS News correspondent who was murdered in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece. Journalists for The New York Times won three of the awards, the most of any organization, and Washington Post journalists won two awards.

David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post won the political reporting award for an investigation of Mr. Trump that raised questions about his charitable giving and exposed the video in which he bragged about making sexual advances on women, a video that, as the Polk announcement noted, ''shaped our national political conversation.''

Alec MacGillis of ProPublica received the national reporting award for his dispatches about support for Mr. Trump and a postelection analysis, ''Revenge of the Forgotten Class.''

Craig Harris of The Arizona Republic won the award for state reporting for investigating the firings of Arizona state employees -- the majority of whom were found to be older workers -- as part of an effort to shrink the state government.

Darwin BondGraham and Ali Winston of the East Bay Express in California won for local reporting for exposing a sex scandal within the Oakland Police Department, in which officers not only exploited an underage sex worker but also leaked information about undercover prostitution stings.

In the foreign reporting category, Nicholas Casey and Meridith Kohut of The New York Times won for their portrayal of the effects of Venezuela's economic crisis on public health, in hospitals without basic necessities where infants lay dying and mental institutions without enough medicine for patients.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a global network of more than 190 journalists who collaborate on articles, won the financial reporting award for ''The Panama Papers.'' From a trove of leaked documents about a Panamanian law firm, they pieced together a picture of a rogue offshore finance industry linked to money laundering and other illegal activities.

Daniel Berehulak of The New York Times won the photojournalism award for ''They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals,'' a photo essay on the dozens of killings he witnessed on the streets of Manila as part of the Philippines' campaign against drugs.

The sports reporting award went to Rebecca R. Ruiz of The New York Times for revealing that a Russian state-run doping program for athletes had swapped test samples and engaged in a cloak-and-dagger scheme at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The Washington Post journalists Lenny Bernstein, Scott Higham and David Fallis won for medical reporting for disclosing that the pharmaceutical industry and its lawyers had hired dozens of officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration after that agency moved to curb a rising opioid epidemic.

Brian M. Rosenthal of The Houston Chronicle won the award for education reporting for exposing a longstanding Texas policy that denied special education services to schoolchildren.

The award for justice reporting went to Christie Thompson of The Marshall Project and Joseph Shapiro of National Public Radio for reporting on a widespread practice in state and federal prisons of doubling up inmates in solitary confinement. Some of those inmates attacked or killed their cellmates.

Anand Gopal, a journalist and author, won the award for magazine reporting for ''The Hell After ISIS'' in The Atlantic, which tells the struggles of one Iraqi family caught between Islamic State terrorists and United States-backed forces.

A team from KARE 11 in Minneapolis -- A. J. Lagoe, Steve Eckert and Gary Knox -- won the award for television reporting for their series ''Invisible Wounds.'' They found that the Department of Veterans Affairs had used unqualified doctors to examine veterans for traumatic brain injuries and deny benefits.

Robert Lewis of WNYC won the award for radio reporting for disclosing that some New York Police Department officials had earned substantial incomes from outside deals and jobs that appeared to be in conflict with department interests.

Anna Deavere Smith won the Polk Career Award. Ms. Smith is an educator, playwright and actress who explores issues such as ethnic conflict and urban riots.

The documentary film award went to Nanfu Wang for ''Hooligan Sparrow,'' about the Chinese women's rights activist Ye Haiyan.

AGE OF ANGER

A History of the Present

By Pankaj Mishra

406 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.

Across the world, a spirit of anarchy is in bloom -- an aimless desire to smash the liberal order, with only the distant, inchoate hope that a better world will emerge from the wreckage. That spirit apparently motivated many Trump voters, who didn't mind that their tribune spoke in clownish generalities, possessed no relevant experience and exhibited an itchy trigger finger. Many of these voters admitted, with little compunction, that they wanted to implant his brash persona in the seat of power to shock the system, because the system deserved a shock. That sentiment inspired Brexit, which passed over warnings of financial doom, and it has transported populists to the cusp of power across Europe. In Pankaj Mishra's telling, a near identical craving for blind revenge leads confused teenagers to join ISIS. He calls it a ''broader and more apocalyptic mood than we have witnessed before.''

This is an important, erudite and flawed book about the deepest roots of this inflamed moment, which was shipped to the printer before the outcome of the American election. The fact that the book contains only a smattering of references to the new president strangely enhances the credibility of its doomsaying. Mishra didn't scramble for a theory to fit the facts. He has a highly developed understanding of the psychic and emotional forces propelling illiberalism's spread across the globe, a movement united by a sense of disappointment, bewilderment and envy -- the spiritual condition that Nietzsche diagnosed as ressentiment. An anger that Mishra both interprets and shares.

This book presents itself as a ''history of the present.'' His premise is that broad swaths of the globe are retracing the past, reliving the same traumas and violent dislocations that accompanied Europe's transition to modernity in the 18th and 19th centuries. A trauma felt most acutely by the ''young man of promise'' in the countries late arriving to capitalism and Enlightenment, especially Germany and Russia. The prospect of freedom and cultural transformation stirred unachievable expectations, which predictably ended in humiliation and rage. This self-righteous West, Mishra argues, obscures its ''own bloody extraordinarily brutal initiation into political and economic modernity,'' as it arrogantly presses the rest of the world to make that same difficult progression.

There's more history than present in Mishra's telling. Just when lessons from the past seem to be building toward a point about ISIS or globalization, he layers on another digression about Dostoyevsky or Ataturk. This tendency can be frustrating -- and one begins to suspect it is a crutch, since our current spate of anarchists, populists and terrorists are so much less theoretically minded and articulate than their antique antecedents. It's a strange imbalance, but Mishra writes with enough style, energy and incision that he carries the reader through.

The antihero of Mishra's tale -- the prophet who best anticipated the crises of our times -- is Jean Jacques Rousseau. And a primary source of his greatness is his hatred of Voltaire. Mishra paints Voltaire as the archetypal elite intellectual, and the worst villain of them all. Voltaire celebrated reason as society's highest virtue. That is, he believed that society should reward talent and brains, not inherited titles. He trumpeted trade and consumerism in language that anticipated the 1990s boosters of globalization. His writings and personal example set terms for the liberalism that would ultimately prevail in Europe.

All this, in Mishra's view, makes Voltaire a world historic hypocrite. Mishra charges Voltaire with creating a society that benefited thinkers like himself, at everyone else's expense. Voltaire preached tolerance but cozied up to authoritarians, especially Catherine of Russia, and apologized for their violent misdeeds. Thanks to his connections, he lived a cosseted life and made a small fortune from financial speculation and the watches he manufactured. Voltaire is portrayed as the spiritual forefather of Davos, Thomas Friedman and all the other clubbable paragons of neoliberalism. Mishra calls him a ''paid-up member of the globally networked elite.''

Rousseau, the graceless outsider, could see straight through Voltaire's cosmopolitan suavity -- and he shredded him.

More to the point, he understood the underlying pathologies of the rising capitalist civilization that Voltaire championed. The market society, Rousseau warned, would dangerously unmoor individuals. He saw how humans aspired to surpass one another in wealth and status, which meant they were capable of great cruelty. The modern world weakened religion and the family, the emotional buffers that provided comfort. Without these supports, individuals came to depend on the opinions of others for their sense of self-worth, which inflicted terrible cases of insecurity, envy and self-hatred. This, in Mishra's argument, remains the nub of the world's problems: ''An existential resentment of other people's being, caused by an intense mix of envy and sense of humiliation and powerlessness, ressentiment, as it lingers and deepens, poisons civil society and undermines political liberty, and is presently making for a global turn to authoritarianism and toxic forms of chauvinism.''

There's no doubting Rousseau's prescience. His criticisms of finance and warnings about inequality are proto-Piketty. But he's a troubling hero. Isaiah Berlin called him the ''greatest militant lowbrow in history and guttersnipe of genius.'' Rousseau celebrated militarism and xenophobia. He unabashedly held up Sparta as his ideal. Mary Wollstonecraft, and generations of subsequent feminists, have charged him with contributing to misogyny in its modern form. Mishra knows all this and should be far warier of his own attraction to Rousseau -- but that would require him to admit a central lapse in his own argument.

Mishra persuasively damns the arrogance of neoliberals, but let's say a few kind words for neoliberalism. On the whole, thanks to the advance of capitalism, we live in a world with less abject poverty, less disease, less oppression and greater material prosperity. Mishra dwells in the realm of ideas and emotions, which get short shrift in most accounts of global politics. So it's bracing and illuminating for him to focus on feelings, what he calls ''the wars in the inner world.'' But he doesn't have much to say about the material reality of economics and politics other than angry bromides about the ''Western model'' and broad, unsupported statements about stagnation. (A sample of his glibness: He notes that ''most people have found the notions of individualism and social mobility to be unrealizable in practice.'' Why then, we might ask, do so many keep trying for it?) Mishra can't find the redeeming qualities in liberal democracy and he can't posit anything to replace it with -- which explains why he must resurrect the repulsive Rousseau, brushing aside his least appealing ideas. Like Rousseau, Mishra sympathizes with traditional society. But it's impossible to defend traditional societies without accounting for their misogyny and xenophobia, which are hardly incidental features. Mishra can't bring himself to make the case, which means he has no hint of prescription for the crisis he dedicates his book to describing.

When the galleys of ''Age of Anger'' arrived, I dived for them. They slipped through the mail slot just after the Trump victory rocked my own faith in progress. Liberalism has no choice but to sincerely wrestle with its discontents, to become reacquainted with its moral blind spots and political weaknesses. Technocracy -- which defines so much of the modern liberal spirit -- doesn't have a natural grasp of psychology and emotion. But if it hopes to stave off the dark forces, it needs to grow adept at understanding the less tangible roots of anger, the human experience uncaptured by data, the resentments that understandably fester. A decent liberalism would read sharp critics like Mishra and learn.

Why Republicans Want to End the Periodic Review Board for Guantáamo Detainees

WASHINGTON —n a letter to President Trump made public this week, 11 Republican senators said that a parole-like board that decides whether to recommend transferring Guantáamo Bay detainees “hould be suspended immediately.”

The next hearing of the Periodic Review Board is scheduled for Feb. 28; the Pentagon this week invited reporters to attend it. If the hearing goes forward as planned, it would be the second of the Trump era. The first was on Feb. 9, the same day that the senators wrote their letter.

The tension over the panel is elevating attention to it and its potential fate under Mr. Trump.

What is the Periodic Review Board?

Established by President Barack Obama in a 2011 executive order, the board looks at Guantáamo detainees who have been deemed untriable but too dangerous to release. The board’ job is to determine whether each such prisoner should be held in open-ended detention or moved to a list of those recommended for transfer to stable countries.

The board is made up of senior Civil Service officials from six agencies: the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the offices of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. It operates by consensus, so each department or agency essentially has a veto, and the heads of each agency can overrule a recommendation.

A decision by the board to put a detainee on the transfer list does not necessarily mean he will be released: The government considers eligibility for transfer a policy recommendation, not a legal right. In the Obama era, dozens of men —ostly lower-level detainees from Yemen —tayed locked up for years after being put on the list because there was no good place to send them.

The Obama administration ultimately reduced the list to five, but the Trump administration has given no indication that it will try to repatriate or resettle the men.

Where did the board come from?

The law of war permits the detention without trial of captured enemies until hostilities end. But that rule was designed for traditional wars that last only a few years. Because the war against Al Qaeda and its progeny may last a lifetime, the government decided it needed a process to decide whether it still made sense to keep holding a particular prisoner as the years passed.

In its second term, George W. Bush’ administration set up a predecessor panel called the Administrative Review Board. Unlike the Periodic Review Board, the panel was made up of military officers only, and detainees had no right to legal representation during their hearings. In 2009, Mr. Obama shut down the Bush-era board and appointed a six-agency task force to review the remaining detainees. It recommended transferring 156, continuing to hold 48 without trial, and prosecuting 36, though not all of those ended up being charged. Mr. Obama later created the boards to periodically re-evaluate those who were neither charged nor already on the transfer list.

What is its record?

Since the Periodic Review Board began operating in late 2013, it has re-examined 63 detainees being held in open-ended detention. To date, the board has designated 37 for transfer —ost of whom are now gone —hile reaffirming the continued detention of 26.

Why is it controversial?

Republicans criticized Mr. Obama’ efforts to whittle down the number of men being held at Guantáamo, warning about the risk of recidivism. According to the office of the director of national intelligence, of 693 former detainees transferred through July 2016, 17.6 percent are “onfirmed”o have re-engaged in militant activity, and another 12.4 percent are “uspected”f having done so.

“here should be no further releases from Gitmo,”r. Trump wrote on Twitter early last month, amid the final transfers of the Obama era. “hese are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.”

Still, most recidivist former detainees left during the Bush administration, which carried out bulk repatriations to countries like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Among those who left since 2009, 5.6 percent are deemed “onfirmed”nd 6.8 percent are “uspected.”

Is Trump legally required to keep the board?

No statute requires the boards to operate. The Geneva Conventions require an initial status hearing for captured enemy fighters but not periodic reviews thereafter. But some legal scholars argue that because this war is open-ended, there may be an implied or customary legal requirement for a parole-like process. If Mr. Trump shuts down the boards, lawyers for detainees would probably use that absence of any process to bring new habeas corpus challenges.

The Trump administration has been circulating various drafts of an executive order on detainee policy, some of which call for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to lead a 120-day review of whether to carry out any more transfers. But Charles Stimson, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was the top Pentagon detainee policy official in the Bush administration’ second term and who helped develop the predecessor Administrative Review Board, argued that the Periodic Review Board served a “aluable function.”

“eeping those boards going is a separate and distinct issue from what criteria they should use and whether or not the secretaries are ultimately going to agree with any recommendation they make,”r. Stimson said. “ would caution the administration against scrapping them unless and until they study the issue more closely.”

Germany’ Taboos, Once a Bulwark Against the Far Right, May Now Be Enabling It; The Interpreter

POTSDAM, Germany —s the far right rises across Europe, its ascent in Germany has seemed among the most alarming and puzzling.

For decades, Germany was thought to be inoculated against far-right politics by its history with Naziism and the Holocaust. But today, Germany is experiencing a resurgence of the right —riven, at least in part, by its effort to overcome past misdeeds by suppressing any vestige of nationalism.

Since World War II, trying to define the German national identity, much less celebrate it, has been taboo. Doing so was seen as a possible step toward the kind of nationalism that once enabled the Nazi regime. Flags were frowned upon, as was standing for the national anthem.

But spurred by a sense of lost control over the country’ borders, economy and politics, many Germans are reaching for a shared identity but finding only an empty space. Into that vacuum slipped the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD, the nation’ fastest-growing party with recent polls showing support at 12 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties.

Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.

The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.

The search for identity

The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.

Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.

But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany’ “roken self-confidence.”

A chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany’ identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.

“nly in Germany, I found it very strange, people don’ want to say ‘ am German,’”he said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD’ message she absorbed.

Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, said, “here has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.”

“t is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,”e said. “nd this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on ‘ever again.’”

For decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.

“ermany has negotiated the European part very well, but the casualty has been Germanness,”aid Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who specializes in the legacy of European fascism.

That smoothed the country’ path back into the community of nations after World War II. But Germans are increasingly concerned about the costs. A July 2016 Pew poll found that half of Germans had an unfavorable view of the European Union. As Euroskepticism rises, a growing minority of Germans are chafing at what they see as pressure to place European identity before national identity.

The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “n Germany, you’e not even allowed to say you’e proud to be German. You have to say you’e European,”he said. “o when these people come in, what are they left with?”

The power of challenging a taboo

When people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany’ traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.

That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany’ far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Bjön Höke, one of the party’ fastest-rising figures.

Addressing the crowd, Mr. Höke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.

Germans are “he only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,”e said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had “he mentality of a totally vanquished people,”e argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.

The crowd’ applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.

“he foundation of being able to move forward is identity,”r. Höke later elaborated in an interview. “here is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.”

Mr. Höke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD’ national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.

That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian Wäder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.

“he definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it’ actually self-destructive,”r. Wäder said. “verything will be tolerated except for being a German.”

Focusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people —unching up against the nation’ political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.

That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.

“his will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,”rofessor Fritsche said.

A minority, but influencing the conversation

The AfD, despite its rapid growth, remains a minority party. Its support reached a high of 15 percent according to a survey by Ipsos in late 2016, but slipped to 12 percent in a Feb. 7 poll by the same firm.

But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD’ populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging —aising the possibility that the party’ political influence could outpace its electoral gains.

Frauke Petry, the party’ national chairwoman, said that the AfD’ ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.

Professor Fritsche’ research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. “hat would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,”e said.

There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they “o not belong to us”nd should be “orbidden wherever that is legally possible.”

And although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who “he people”re was something for all to decide, “ot just a few, no matter how loud they are.”

Mr. Höke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a “hancellor-dictator”ho had broken German law by opening the country’ borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her “egime.”

“e Germans have to be self-aware,”e said in the interview. “e can see our state falling apart; it’ falling apart before our eyes. It’ about survival.”

The news coming out of Washington this week has been a whirlwind to follow, in keeping with the past month. A top White House official was out, a cabinet nominee got the boot, reports surfaced that Trump campaign aides were in regular contact with Russian intelligence officials throughout the race, and President Trump took a national security briefing in the open at Mar-a-Lago, to name a few of this week’ stories.

 Journalists have been left struggling to keep up, as a Times article illustrated on Thursday. Still, some readers complain that The Times is overcovering the capital.

Of course it’ important and newsworthy when we have a new president and change of administration, but lately it seems Trump news absolutely dominates the first section and the front page. Surely there are other important stories happening in the world, but they seem to be taking a back seat to the overwhelming proportion of Trump stories, relegating them to a seemingly lesser status no matter how important they are.

Chas. Schwartz

I know it is still early days, but I’ struggling to get a sense of perspective in the Times’ coverage of the Trump administration. What I see now feels like: “ere is the latest bad thing Trump has done.”ut some nuance would be useful to more easily understand what was bad, really bad or even worse. Maybe if —r when —e’ done something good too, I wonder how that might be covered? I realize that The Times has become the de facto opposing voice after the recent election, but it often feels I’ being screamed at day after day.

Greg Neilson, Sydney, Australia

Yet, as one reader pointed out on Twitter, not only is there an appetite for such news —he ten most-read stories on the Times site Wednesday afternoon were all Washington related —he stories are some of the most significant of the day.

The public editor’ take: A Trump overdose is a potential hazard to all of us, but this week offered some pretty exceptional journalism. Cheers to the Washington scribes.

Sticking with the president, several readers wrote in in a continued effort to push The Times to qualify Trump’ statements.

Today’ Times has one particularly bad headline: “rump Vows Quick Action to Stop Terrorism After Setback in Court.”he Times usually gets headlines right. And as a former reporter and editor I’ well aware of headline constraints. But “top Terrorism” How about something a little more accurate like “rump Vows Quick Action After Court Setback on Immigration Ban”r, if “an”s too strong a word for your headline writers, how about just leaving that word off (“rump Vows Quick Action After Court Setback on Immigration” or like “rump Vows Quick Action After Court Setback on Executive Order.”

Joan Abramson, San Francisco

Another reader complained about the language used to summarize the same article, on new border security measures being pursued by Trump.

A bullet point on the home page that described the article said: “resident Trump promised to introduce new measures by next week to prevent terrorists entering the United States.”The first time I noticed this description of Trump’ order was the first description of the appeals court decision.) But many of us (including national security experts who wrote briefs supporting the stay of the order) would argue that Trump’ measures make us LESS safe, by supporting the ISIS recruitment claim that there is a war between Islam and the West. Therefore, it is irresponsible to describe the order using Trump’ claim, as one “o prevent terrorists from entering”hen it is preventing peaceful people from entering and may actually have the effect of turning people into terrorists. Wouldn’ it be more accurate to say “hat Trump claims are designed to prevent terrorists…”

Lynn Caporale, Manhattan

The public editor’ take: The life of a headline writer is not easy. In this case, I think these readers make a good point. It’ one thing for Trump to assert that his initiatives will stop terrorism, but these headlines could easily be seen as The Times thinking so too. I spoke to Jill Taylor, the head of the copy desks, about this issue, and she agreed that both the headline and the bullet summary lacked the necessary clarification of Trump’ intent. Though the tight space makes doing so difficult, she said, it is necessary nonetheless.

Several readers took issue with the way one of Trump’ senior advisers, Stephen Miller, was described in a profile —amely, that the story noted his religion.

Is it a policy of The New York Times to refer to an individual as Jewish, even if the individual’ Jewish ancestry or Judaism, per se, is without context in the story? This appears to be the case in the piece by Glenn Thrush and Jennifer Steinhauer profiling Stephen Miller. We are told that “t Duke, Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with Richard Spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university’ Young Conservatives chapter.”

Hank Green

Thrush, the lead reporter for the piece, took the time to reply to Green. “o you think it would be appropriate NOT to reference his religion considering Mr. Miller’ relationship with Mr. Spencer, a known white supremacist?”hrush wrote. “hy deny a reader the important context about Mr. Miller?”

The public editor’ take: The Times stylebook states that “he religion of a person in the news should be mentioned only when it is pertinent and its pertinence is clear to the reader.”nfortunately, that’ a bit vague. What’ clear to some readers won’ be to others. In this case, I’ with Thrush. As a reader, I found it interesting and informative that Stephens, a Jew, was at one time friendly with a man who emerged later as a white supremacist.

A Times reporter who covered Hillary Clinton’ campaign, Amy Chozick, is taking leave to write a book about her experience covering Clinton for eight years, on and off. One reader was left wondering about how such an arrangement would work.

How do Times reporters who have book deals (and, presumably, their editors) decide what to tell the readers in real time and what to “ave for the book” Given that the information gathered and the access provided emanate from Times employment, how is that slippery slope negotiated?

Gene Krzyzynski, Tonawanda, N.Y.

While we can’ speak to anyone’ specific book contract, we asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his take. He told us that he has discussed this question with other reporters in the past and it has generally been a nonissue. If a reporter working on a book comes across bombshell news, Corbett said, The Times wants it and the reporter is generally eager to write it for the paper. For one thing, he added, these days reporters know that “aving it for the book”ay well mean they’l get scooped by some competitor.

Leaving politics and turning to real estate for this mailbag’ grand finale: One reader took issue with a column about a couple that put their Catskills vacation home up for auction by way of an essay contest.

I’ concerned by the lack of some basic facts in this article —he lack of which gives the impression that this is a contest rather than a scam. The rules of the contest allow Mr. Bares and Ms. Lavorgna to keep $49 (roughly one third) of the $149 entry fee if they do not receive 5,500 entries. This means that if 5,499 people enter the contest, the owners have the right to cancel the contest, award no prize (thereby keeping the house), and still keep $269,451 (which is roughly the assessed value of the property). They are then free to run the contest again, if they so choose. How is this anything but a scam, and why wouldn’ The New York Times report on it as such, rather than offering essentially free advertising to the scammers? (The article included a link to the promotional piece that markets the contest.) I understand that the article included some negative opinions about these contests in general (though mostly from real estate agents who would, of course, take a dim view of anything that cuts into their business), and yet the article failed to include these basic facts.

Jacqueline Davis, Needham, Mass.

We asked Vivian Toy, the real estate editor, for her view.

The reporter, Ronda Kaysen, exhibits a healthy amount of skepticism in the piece. She points out that the owners were previously unable to sell the house and are holding this essay contest as a way to try to get the amount they were unable to get on the open market. In addition to quoting a broker who doesn’ believe the house is worth what the owners hope to get for it, Ronda also quotes an appraiser who calls the contest “ gimmick.”he rules of the contest are plainly stated, including the full disclosure that the owners will keep $49 of the $149 entry fee if they do not receive 5,500 entries. While the reader may see this as proof that they plan to keep a substantial amount of money after canceling the contest, couldn’ the disclosed plan to keep $49 for administrative fees be a hedge against the possibility that they only receive a few hundred entries? You may question why anyone would want to enter such a contest, but it could hardly be called a scam if the administrative fee is fully disclosed. We’e heard about these types of essay-writing contests for properties around the country before, I think the value in telling the story was the chance to explain how these contests do (and don’) work.

For those hoping to scribble their way to that Catskills home, we wish you luck.

President Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service.

For more coverage, read our live analysis.

TRUMP: Thank you very much.

I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.

And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.

And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.

Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, ''never Trump.'' And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.

So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.

I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.

And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.

I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.

A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ''Oh, that's good.'' Now it means, ''That's good for jobs.'' Very different.

Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.

TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.

I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say -- they're honest and fantastic.

But much of it is not a -- the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea -- we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.

Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.

We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.

They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer -- another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.

We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted -- it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.

We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.

Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.

And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.

270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.

And -- but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.

And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague -- highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.

So, if the Democrats who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.

I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks -- in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.

We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.

Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.

We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say ''let me see your regulations'' and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental -- all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.

We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.

We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.

We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke.

We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.

The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.

I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.

In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.

We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.

TRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.

We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.

So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.

I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.

You look at Rex Tillerson. He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.

Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.

Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.

Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.

Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.

General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.

Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.

Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.

Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.

And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.

This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.

Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.

And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.

Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.

And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.

It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.

I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.

Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?

You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.

Yes, go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, ''I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right.'' He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, ''Huh, that's fine.'' That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.

You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.

But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.

Yes?

QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.

I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.

The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.

That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.

So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.

TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.

He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.

Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.

As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.

And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.

So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.

So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.

But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?

That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.

And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.

OK, go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Yeah.

QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?

TRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?

QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?

What-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.

TRUMP: We are.

QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?

TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.

The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.

As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.

It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ''well I don't see'' -- to me, he was doing the job.

The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said ''doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.'' But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.

That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.

QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...

TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.

QUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...

TRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.

We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.

But I said ''you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen'' but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said ''that's terrible that it was leaked'' but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself ''what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?''

What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.

So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the ''Washington Post'' and gets put into the ''New York Times'' and I'm saying ''what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?

We got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.

QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?

TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.

It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.

I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.

People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.

TRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.

I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.

And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.

And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.

Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --

TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure

QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --

TRUMP: No, I didn't.

QUESTION: -- prior to your -- TRUMP: No, I didn't.

QUESTION: -- inauguration.

TRUMP: No, I didn't.

QUESTION: And then fired him --

TRUMP: Excuse me.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.

I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.

No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?

QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.

TRUMP: OK.

QUESTION: So, pass that along --

TRUMP: Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK?

QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --

TRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.

QUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.

TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.

QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --

TRUMP: I was OK with it.

QUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you -- TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.

QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.

TRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.

QUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --

TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?

QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --

TRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.

QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?

TRUMP: Do you mind?

QUESTION: Yes, sir.

TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.

He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.

I don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.

Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.

Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, ''I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.'' QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?

TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.

And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ''tone.'' The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.

I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.

But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.

Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.

I -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.

Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.

Tomorrow, they will say, ''Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.'' I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.

But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ''Donald Trump rants and raves.'' I'm not ranting and raving.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...

TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?

Sit down. Sit down. We'll...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...

TRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.

QUESTION: Doesn't that under...

TRUMP: Very fake news.

QUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...

(LAUGHTER)

TRUMP: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.

TRUMP: And you're not related to our new...

QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.

TRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.

QUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.

TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, ''No, sir.'' I said, ''Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.''

QUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like ''fake news''? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.

TRUMP: I do that.

QUESTION: When you call it ''fake news,'' you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.

TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, ''Wow, that's going to be a great story.'' And I'll get killed.

I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.

So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.

Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?

Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN, I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).

You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying ''here's my chief of staff,'' a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?

We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said ''you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.'' I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).

I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know -- you know, whatever reason. But -- and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.

And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.

QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...

TRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public -- that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.

Now tomorrow, you'll say ''Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.'' It's not terrible. It's good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.

Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?

Hillary Clinton -- that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said ''I know politically it's probably not good for me.'' The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.

Everyone in this country's going to say ''oh, it's so great.'' That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But -- but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.

Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said ''you know.'' He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying ''you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.'' OK?

And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia -- and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.

QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?

QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...

TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.

So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.

Yes?

QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.

TRUMP: OK.

QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.

TRUMP: Not good.

QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.

TRUMP: Not good.

QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...

TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ''Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.'' Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ''Oh, isn't that wonderful.'' But I know you well enough.

Then you would say, ''Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that.'' Look, all of the...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?

TRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.

Yes, I think that I've already...

QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?

TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.

Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.

Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.

If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.

They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

QUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...

TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?

QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.

QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...

TRUMP: They all happened recently.

No...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?

TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.

Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?

But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.

QUESTION: Can we...

TRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.

QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?

TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. ''We are going to attack Mosul in four months.'' Then three months later, ''We are going to attack Mosul in one month.'' ''Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.''

In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ''Yes, here's what we're going to do.'' I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.

TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.

OK.

QUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...

TRUMP: Where are you from?

QUESTION: BBC.

TRUMP: Here's another beauty.

QUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.

TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: Just like CNN right?

QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...

TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...

QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...

TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.

Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.

We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.

That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.

Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.

Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.

You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.

Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.

Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.

Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.

Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.

QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...

TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?

TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.

QUESTION: During the election?

TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...

QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..

TRUMP: Look, look, look...

QUESTION: ... of the election?

TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?

QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.

I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.

Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.

I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.

We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.

I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.

Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.

QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?

TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?

He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?

QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...

TRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.

QUESTION: Mr....

TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...

TRUMP: Go ahead.

QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).

Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.

So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.

See, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.

I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.

So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?

TRUMP: Yeah.

QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...

TRUMP: It's a very fair question.

QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.

TRUMP: Right.

QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?

TRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.

In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.

We're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.

But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.

I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.

But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.

And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?

QUESTION: Mr. President...

(CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?

TRUMP: Yes.

QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...

TRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.

And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.

She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.

And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.

She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.

I'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.

They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?

TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.

QUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.

TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --

TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.

QUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.

TRUMP: Yep.

QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?

TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.

QUESTION: I'm very professional.

TRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.

I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.

And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.

It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.

You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.

They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.

We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.

There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.

I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?

QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --

TRUMP: Am I going to include who?

QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional --

TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?

QUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --

TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?

QUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --

TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?

QUESTION: I'm just a reporter.

TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.

QUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.

TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.

I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.

QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.

TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told -- he was probably told ''don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.''

And that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.

QUESTION: (inaudible)

TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.

QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...

TRUMP: ...And some of it -- can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?

No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.

QUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?

TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?

QUESTION: What are you going to do about -- what are you going to do about (inaudible).

TRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very -- no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided -- I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.

We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on -- you know, we're going to stop -- we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.

We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me -- but this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.

It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.

The Syrian civil war has left nearly a half-million people dead, displaced millions more, and turned one of its largest cities, Aleppo, into an open-air slaughterhouse.

The war is destroying antiquity too. For just under a year, from May 2015 to March 2016, the Islamic State held control of the ancient central city of Palmyra, a boomtown that became a Roman colony in the third century A.D. To their viciousness against the men and women of Syria and northern Iraq, the Islamic State added brutality to culture. In that year they destroyed several temples where Palmyrenes had worshiped a panoply of pre-Islamic gods. They beheaded the archaeologist Khaled al-Assad, the leading authority on Palmyra's history, and broadcast his death online. The city's museum was ransacked. Several captives were tied to ancient columns and executed with explosives: crimes against the present and the past at once.

Last spring, the Russian-backed Syrian Army routed the jihadists -- but in December the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) retook Palmyra. Last month they blasted a Roman amphitheater, as well as a tetrapylon, an entranceway formed by a quartet of columns. On Monday, the Russian defense ministry released drone footage that purports to show new destruction to the theater, as well as numerous trucks circling the heritage site.

To understand what's being lost, spend some time looking at ''The Legacy of Ancient Palmyra,'' a new digital exhibition of prints and photographs of this pre-Islamic metropolis at getty.edu. The first online exhibition by the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles -- a cousin to the J. Paul Getty Museum -- it is organized by Frances Terpak, a curator at the institute, and Peter Louis Bonfitto, a research associate there.

The website evokes the syncretic, multicultural wonders of Palmyra, many of which are now destroyed, through two caches of historical images: 18th-century etchings of Palmyra after the drawings of the architect Louis-Françis Cassas, and 19th-century photographs by Louis Vignes, a French naval officer. The latter were acquired in 2015 by the Getty; they're the oldest known photographs of Palmyra, and most have not been seen widely before.

Europeans had encountered Palmyra as early as 1691, when a group of English merchants in Aleppo trekked through the desert to see the ruined city, and reported on the mixture of Greco-Roman and Persian motifs in its religious and civic buildings. A 1753 book on Palmyra by the British classicist Robert Wood included painstaking illustrations of the city's architectural ornamentation, which became a runaway success among British designers. Robert Adam, the dean of Georgian neoclassicism, based the ceilings of Osterley Park, a west London mansion, on those of the Temple of Bel, which feature blooming rosettes set in octagonal recesses.

But the young Cassas, who had developed a passion for antiquity while studying in Rome, illustrated Palmyra with unprecedented dedication. He was dispatched to the Near East by the French ambassador in Constantinople, who commissioned Cassas to document significant sites in Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria. He arrived in May 1785, just shy of his 29th birthday, and in less than a month Cassas had drawn every building in Palmyra. Some he depicted as he saw them, bestrewn with marble stumps and fallen capitals.

''There are columns and capitals overturned in the middle of entablatures and door frames, richly adorned and half broken,'' Cassas wrote. ''Beyond all these wonderful ruins extends an ocean of blazing sand, stretching all the way back to the horizon that appears to shimmer like a blue sea.''

Cassas also made careful diagrams of the floor plans and elevations of Palmyra's buildings, including the Temple of Bel, a monumental house of worship destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Others he retrofitted into capriccios of the multifaith city, whose inhabitants worshiped a collection of Babylonian, Phoenician and Greek gods. Still more of Cassas's prints captured the ruins of the past amid Orientalist visions of the present: turbaned sheikhs, grinning camels.

Nearly a century later, Vignes took part in a French scientific expedition to the Near East, where he photographed the Dead Sea and the sites of Petra. He then continued to Palmyra by himself, and there, in 1864, he took the first photographs of the ancient city. The expedition's patron died shortly afterward, and so Vignes's Palmyra images, unlike his Petra photographs, were never widely distributed. Some exist only as single prints. The Getty acquired and digitized them two years ago, as ISIS began to destroy the city.

Vignes's hazy, sepia-toned photographs of Palmyra disclose that some of the city's monuments were in good repair in the mid-19th century--among them the Temple of Baalshamin, now dynamited, where Palmyrenes worshiped a god of Phoenician origin in a Hellenistic setting. Other photographs show antique sites amid piles of rubble. After Syria won its independence in 1946, local and international archaeologists began to excavate at Palmyra, and they unearthed far more of the ancient city -- marketplaces, forums, temple foundations -- that Vignes's camera saw only as earth.

What enthralled Cassas and Vignes about Palmyra is precisely what ISIS hates about it: They discovered the material vestiges of a multilingual and multiconfessional society, nourished by commerce from East and West. In part, ISIS's iconoclasm there has flowed from the polytheistic history of Palmyra, which stands in rebuke to their Salafist convictions. (They have also blown up the tombs of Shiite and Sufi saints, whose interpretations of Islam they consider heretical.) Just as much, ISIS leaders destroy cultural heritage as an incitement -- ''an act of psychological warfare,'' as the British archaeologist David Wengrow has said.

For all the insights of ''The Legacy of Ancient Palmyra,'' its web design is clunky. Thumbnail images are too small to see properly in the mobile version, while in desktop format Cassas's prints often appear with severe moiréatterning at lower screen resolution. In one sense, the digital reproductions are no substitute for seeing these prints and photographs in a proper museum show. (More than two dozen of Cassas's original drawings were on view last year in ''Palmyra: What's Left,'' an exhibition at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany.)

But in another sense, it is fitting that these images should circulate digitally -- along the same networks that ISIS has so effectively used to advertise its own inhumanity. Its war has been waged through images as well as armaments. We need images too, from the past and the present, to guard the ideals we so often fail to realize but cannot live without. These prints and photographs are more than just testaments to a threatened archaeological inheritance; they are traces of explorations and crosscultural exchange too many now seek to shut down.

MOSUL, Iraq -- The water taps are dry in Rashidiya.

The water and sewage system collapsed in this eastern Mosul neighborhood after 100 days of street combat. On Sunday, Haitham Younis Wahab and his neighbor Shamsuldeen Ahmed Saed decided to do something about it.

Out came the sledgehammers, steel pipes and shovels.

The two men pounded and dug for three days. Sixteen feet down. Twenty feet down. Nothing. And then, 26 feet beneath the cracked sidewalk, they struck water. After all, they live just a half mile from the muddy Tigris River, which divides eastern and western Mosul.

We came across the two neighbors as we walked through the crumbling streets of Rashidiya to find out how residents were faring three weeks after Iraqi security forces had driven most Islamic State fighters from eastern Mosul.

Every few blocks was another freshly dug well. Some residents had penetrated worn pavement by pounding a pipe with a sledgehammer for hours and days. Others dug through the muddy earth with picks, shovels or hand-cranked drills operated by two men.

Mr. Wahab and Mr. Saed had cobbled together sections of hose and a small electric pump for sucking up free underground water. Somehow they had coaxed water up through this jury-rigged system -- Mosul MacGyvers making use of the tools at hand.

''It took us three days, working every morning and afternoon,'' Mr. Saed, 50, said as he and Mr. Wahab struggled to connect the well's protruding steel pipe to the rest of the contraption with a section of tubing.

''We don't drink the water,'' Mr. Wahab, 30, said. It was good only for washing and cleaning dishes, he said.

For drinking water, residents buy bottled water brought in and sold by anyone who can reach more secure areas of eastern Mosul, where water as well as fruit, vegetables and other food are readily available.

Life in Rashidiya these days requires ingenuity and perseverance. Because the electric grid has been knocked out, several entrepreneurs have set up diesel generators and are charging residents to hook up their homes.

Just down the street, Dhahir Hasan, a burly 32-year-old, cranks up an ancient, oily diesel generator twice a day -- from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Mr. Hasan said he gets 300,000 Iraqi dinars a month, about $235, from the owner of the generator, who charges local residents 9,000 dinars, about $7, per ampere per month to hook up their homes.

Most homes require at least three amperes a month, Mr. Hasan said. That comes to roughly $21 a month for many families in an area where most people have lost their jobs.

Abu Mohammed, 70, was not happy about paying generator fees for power a few hours a day. He was also frustrated by something else: He and his son had hit water after gouging out a hole 33 feet deep, but the water they got was hardly worth it.

''It smelled awful and we couldn't use it,'' he said.

Mohammed Jameel, 41, had better luck. For days, he pounded a pipe into the ground and finally hit water about 26 feet down this week. He was holding a hose, letting sluggish brown well water run into the gutter.

The murky water was gritty and left behind a gray residue.

''We have to let it run a long time before it turns clear,'' Mr. Jameel said.

Two streets away, Mahmoud Yunis, 33, a powerfully built former police officer with a pair of pliers tucked into his belt, yanked on a hose connected to a 30-foot-deep well he had dug. He said water had trickled out of the hose for five minutes, then stopped.

Mr. Yunis chatted amiably for a few minutes, then sent me on my way. He pulled out his pliers and went back to work.
