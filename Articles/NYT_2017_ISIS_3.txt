CORRECTION APPENDEDHours before the start of the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, every Metro car leading to the National Mall was packed so tight that it could take on no more riders. At station after station, the train doors would open, and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters -- women, men, children, babies, the occasional dog -- waiting on the platform. As people emerged from underground into the morning air, it was hard to tell where to go, so they found their way by gauging the human density, moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all. There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there -- activists and celebrities speaking into microphones -- but much of the crowd couldn't see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers.

 By the time they were meant to march, the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route, from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House.

The signs they carried spoke to any number of issues: immigration, abortion, race, the environment, inequality, the new president. REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink ''pussyhats'' that many marchers wore -- a reference to Donald Trump's caught-on-tape boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals -- had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image.

It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters -- estimates range from three to five million -- took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla., Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N.D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump's election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women.

Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made working-class white voters ''feel excluded,'' according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn't get their heartland relatives on their side.

But a crew of bummed-out, angry women was still aiming its ire at Trump. In the hours after his victory on Nov. 8, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted to Facebook, suggesting a march on Washington. Some women on the East Coast had the same idea. At first, these suggestions were so impulsive that they seemed almost metaphorical. But within days, tens of thousands of women had pledged to join in. Over the course of two months, the idea became something far bigger than initially imagined. Eventually, an entire organizing team would have permits, T-shirts, fleets of buses, portable toilets, celebrity sponsors and support from Gloria Steinem. Men meekly asked their female family members and Twitter followers: ''Are we allowed to join?'' By the middle of January, with the event shaping up to be the anti-Trump demonstration, the New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait worried that ''Women's March'' was too niche an organizing principle -- it was a ''bad name,'' he tweeted, a divisive ''brand.''

The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump's executive order halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, the march's striking proof of concept -- hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you -- fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition's first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that ''women'' was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump.

Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women's movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold.

Clinton's loss on Nov. 8 was a pivotal, identity-shifting moment in the course of the American women's movement. In an evening, the would-be first female president was shoved to the side by what a sizable chunk of the nation saw as that classic historical figure: the male chauvinist pig. In parts of the popular imagination, it wasn't just a loss for Clinton or for the Democratic Party. It was a repudiation of feminism itself.

But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn't run for president as a ''women's candidate''; if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. ''They do not want someone who would be the first mama,'' he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO's ''Veep'' would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. ''I can't identify myself as a woman!'' she tells her staff. ''People can't know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.''

In the eight years between Clinton's first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women's blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women's magazines did -- fashion, movies, sex -- but taking on the women's magazines too. By Obama's second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a co-founder of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women's site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to ''manspreading.'' Pop stars -- people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift -- were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online.

Feminism became increasingly popular, but in a very specific way -- one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online. The feminist priorities of this new media landscape tended to involve topics that middle-class women would experience firsthand: reproductive rights, catcalling, campus rape, professional opportunity, pop-culture representation. The writers setting its tone tended to be young women who were asked to produce large amounts of clickable copy, for not much money, in very little time, exploring feminist issues not through time-intensive reporting but through ''takes'' on the women already making news: the work-life balance of Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer; the pay gap between Jennifer Lawrence and her male co-stars. Some content chased sexist slights down to the most passing personal concerns, like an item from The Huffington Post that sighed: ''There is no proper way for a woman to cut her hair, let alone do anything right in this world.''

It's not that women's activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women's liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J.Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women's market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women's rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered ''freedom from household drudgery''; Shredded Wheat promised a ''declaration of independence'' from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size.

It's telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as self-help. This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman's frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists -- they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting ''the integrity of women who are ambitious.'' Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had ''been taking a feminist stance without actually saying so.'' Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity.

In 2013, ''Lean In,'' by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this pop-cultural subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book ''sort of a feminist manifesto,'' but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on ''internal obstacles'' and ''dismantle the hurdles in ourselves.'' This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the corporate-celebrity feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: ''We're committed to solving problems. If we can't find a solution, we'll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag).''

By the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn't just permitted to run as a feminist -- she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women's debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female major-party candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be ''safe, legal and rare -- and by rare I mean rare.'' In last year's debates, she stopped qualifying her support. ''I will defend Planned Parenthood,'' she said in one. ''I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.''

Meanwhile, her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the pop-cultural feminist mode. The candidate affirmed her feminism in a video interview with Lena Dunham, posed in a Kim Kardashian selfie and made a cameo on ''Broad City.'' Her campaign posted a BuzzFeed-style listicle informing Latinos that Clinton was ''just like your abuela.'' (With the Twitter hashtag #NotMyAbuela, those voters begged to differ.) Her site sold embroidered pillows that said ''A Woman's Place Is in the White House'' and a T-shirt with a big ''YAAAS, HILLARY!'' printed over her senior portrait from high school. After Trump accused her of playing ''the woman's card,'' her campaign introduced a free hot-pink ''Official Hillary for America Woman Card'' that drove more than $2 million in donations within days. One young woman earnestly prodded her at an Iowa campaign event: ''If you could choose, would you rather be the president or Beyoncé''

Pop feminism, having been washed of its political urgency, was now being integrated back into politics at the highest level. The candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement. Her image became closely aligned with two metaphors -- the pantsuit and the glass ceiling -- that speak to a particular kind of woman: a corporate careerist at the top of her field. A ''secret'' Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, popped up to encourage Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits to the polls. When she clinched the Democratic nomination for president last June -- the one she would formally accept the following month, dressed in suffragist white -- Clinton called back to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, where ''a small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights.'' The feminist project started there, she implied -- and she was going to finish it.

When Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the long-simmering fractures between different groups of women exploded into view. Ninety-four percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton's campaign. Despite Trump's palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women -- and that infamous tape -- he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity.

In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group's founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn't exactly a call to activism -- it was a coffee-table book. ''You are a force, Pantsuit Nation,'' she wrote. ''Let's see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world.'' The idea brought on a revolt. ''The N.R.A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,'' one commenter wrote. ''Pantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is 'storytelling' and now, selling books. What a colossal waste.''

But for some outside observers, this was a productive comeuppance. Rhon Manigault-Bryant, an associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts, published ''An Open Letter to White Liberal Feminists,'' on the website Black Perspectives, expressing her disappointment that it had taken Donald Trump to shake them into her reality. ''I am delighted that you have received the potential awakening of a lifetime, and that now you might actually get what so many of us have been describing all along,'' she wrote. ''Welcome to that deep perpetual angst. Embrace it, and allow it to motivate you to a deeper form of action.''

In those same November weeks, the nascent march-on-Washington project was navigating its own identity crisis. Some of the early organizers had romantic-comedy-type jobs -- pastry chef, yoga instructor. One of the women, Bob Bland, a fashion designer, had amassed a small online following by designing ''NASTY WOMAN'' and ''BAD HOMBRE'' T-shirts and selling them online. ''I had this whole network of 'nasty women' and 'bad hombres,' '' she told me. ''After the election, they were looking to me like, 'What are we going to do next?' ''

Disparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides.

The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women's organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women's movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women's rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: ''The leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps.'' A ''buzz of disapprobation'' spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman's testimony would distract from the convention's focus. ''Don't let her speak, Mrs. Gage -- it will ruin us,'' one said. ''Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced.''

Throughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women's suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because ''there were very few women in those days who dared to 'speak in meeting,' '' as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth's very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. ''That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,'' she said. ''Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!'' She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. ''I have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain't I a woman?''

In that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man; as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth's testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her ''with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude.''

But two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women's meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists' signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or working-class ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an ''asylum for the trash of all nations,'' arguing that women's suffrage ought to be restricted. ''Think what it means to give it to all women,'' she said. ''Our criminal and pauper men have wives; there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor; there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals.''

One curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to ''stand aside to see 'Sambo' walk into the kingdom first,'' as she put it in The National Anti-Slavery Standard.

Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women's social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged. Whites-only clubs leveraged middle-class women's leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women's Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, ''it is not a fad.''

Black women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn't just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too.

This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism's second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the best-selling author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting's host -- Muriel Fox, the highest-ranking female executive at the world's largest public-relations agency -- were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they ''went bonkers.''

Friedan's 1963 book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' had been an awakening for a class of white, married, middle-class women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a ''mainstream'' feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program.

Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and ''focus her attention on matters of Black Power.'' As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women's Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn't account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism -- it was ''merely female self-aggrandizement.''

There has never been one women's movement. It's difficult, for example, to say that the American feminist project started in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848, because black women were not invited to that convention. It's hard to say that electing a woman as president would have been feminism's crowning achievement, because the success of one woman does not naturally trickle down to all. The history of the women's movement is one of warring factions and sharp self-criticism. But its 150 years of navigating internal disputes put it in a position to lead what seemed, at the end of last fall, like a highly divided left.

''It's embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn't know the term 'intersectionality' when we started,'' Bob Bland, the Women's March co-chairwoman, told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working ''in so many different intersectionalities'' and hoped to reach a ''a wide intersectionality of people'' in a march that reflected ''all of the different intersections of human rights.''

That magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberlérenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be ''compound discrimination'' -- both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as African-Americans or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions; when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides.

That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw's paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until ''intersectionality'' became a rallying cry -- the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of single-issue feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of Obama-era pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of class-consciousness, its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a trickle-down, professional-oriented feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It's hard to ''lean in'' to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People.com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton.

Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: ''This is not the place for divisiveness.'') Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something; it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism's mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions -- all in the space of two months.

Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble -- a white producer and co-founder of the media company OkayAfrica -- made a pivotal intervention in its planning. ''I thought the stakes were so high,'' she told me. ''It needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country.'' At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists -- Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory -- got on board. These women hadn't necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn't necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march's Facebook page: ''Can you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?''

The three women -- one Chicana Latina, one Palestinian-American, one black -- met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a juvenile-justice initiative. In 2015, they organized a nine-day march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was ''How do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?''

Meanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. ''I don't have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,'' Sarsour told me. ''I've been learning a lot,'' she said, and working toward becoming ''more comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn't particularly include Muslim women.'' The organizers appeared on the hip-hop radio morning show ''The Breakfast Club'' and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women's club with a $2,250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson.

When I called Kimberlérenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn't hear the rally, and ''I'm kind of glad about it,'' she told me. ''We were in this sea of humanity.'' Wading through the crowd, she said, ''I saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women's March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time.''

The women's movement's tendency toward a singular perspective is ''not an exceptional problem for feminism,'' Crenshaw told me. ''Patriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn't always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing.''

''The million-dollar question is: Can these feminisms live together under an anti-Trump banner?'' Crenshaw said. ''It happened for 24 hours all across the world.''

When I made my way back to my hotel after the march, the cheers of the crowd fading into the distance, I opened my laptop and saw a different version of what I had just seen in person. Now it was all filtered through my own social-media bubble -- that of a middle-class white woman who lives in Brooklyn. Facebook's trending topics, tailored to fulfill each user's particular online habits, served me up a pop-celebrity version of the day's events. It pointed me toward the speeches of Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, and nobody else. As scenes of the march traveled through the media and across the web, the story spun out in even more directions. Twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march: DON'T FORGET: WHITE WOMEN VOTED FOR TRUMP and BLACK WOMEN TRIED TO SAVE Y'ALL and I'LL SEE YOU NICE WHITE LADIES AT THE NEXT #BLACKLIVESMATTER MARCH, RIGHT?

But for the moment, at least, Trump appears to be the great uniter. In the days and weeks since the march, its energy spilled into spontaneous actions across the country, with protesters coming together on behalf of Muslims and immigrants. Donations poured into Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Congressional switchboards were inundated with calls. When The Washington Post polled Americans post-march, it registered a huge shift in energy among Democrats, especially Democratic women, 40 percent of whom said they planned to get more involved in activism.

But liberals are not the only ones drawing inspiration from the protests. Flip to Fox News, click around conservative blogs or browse pro-Trump Twitter, and you can watch the demonstrations fuel a different kind of opposition narrative. After the march, Fox News set clips of rally speeches to foreboding music. Breitbart published photos with the headline ''See what a massive, Hillary shaped bullet America just dodged?'' The right-wing Media Research Center aggregated the most ''vile and ridiculous signs.'' Twitter exploded with anti-Muslim attacks on Linda Sarsour, who was called a ''terrorist'' who ''loves ISIS.'' When the annual March for Life hit the Mall to demonstrate against abortion rights, The Blaze called it ''the real women's march.'' (The Women's March did, at one point, remove the name of an anti-abortion group from its list of partners, after an uproar.) According to Public Policy Polling, 48 percent of Trump voters think the protesters who convened at airports to protest the travel ban were paid by George Soros. Trump tweeted recently: ''Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!''

In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves ''the silent majority,'' while his critics identify as the ''popular vote.'' When I called Eleanor Smeal, a co-founder of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. ''We don't really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,'' she told me. ''I think they're with us.''

For now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too -- including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they're quick to tell you that they're of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. ''I know of no other time when it would be more important,'' Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. ''That's not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it.''

Correction: February 19, 2017, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Feb. 12 about feminism misstated the month of a speech by Hillary Clinton in which she mentioned the Seneca Falls convention of 1848. The speech was made in June 2016, when she clinched the Democratic nomination for president. It was not made in July, when she formally accepted the nomination.

ANKARA, Turkey —resident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and the officials around him rarely miss a chance to call out Western hostility toward Islam.

When Danish newspapers published cartoons a decade ago that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, Mr. Erdogan quickly called for checks on press freedom. After the 2015 attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, Mr. Erdogan warned that its blasphemous cartoons were “reaking terror”n Muslims. And when Donald J. Trump made Islamophobia a central part of his presidential campaign last summer, Mr. Erdogan called for the rebranding of a pair of towers in Istanbul that bear Mr. Trump’ name.

Yet in recent weeks, Mr. Erdogan has kept quiet as President Trump has taken office and signed an executive order banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

That is in large part because, at least for the moment, Mr. Erdogan sees Mr. Trump’ rise to the presidency as a chance to reset relations with the United States, which had nearly collapsed in the last years of the Obama administration, officials say.

“ow we have all the prospects of a fresh start,”lnur Cevik, a senior adviser to Mr. Erdogan, said during an interview at the presidential palace in Ankara, the Turkish capital. “e have an opening with Mr. Trump.”

Turkish-American relations frayed over differing views on the war in Syria and the widespread belief in Turkey that the United States played a role in a failed coup last summer. In recent months, Turkey grew frustrated at America’ refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based leader of a religious social movement whom the Turkish government accuses of organizing the coup attempt in July. This compounded a longer-running feud concerning American support for the leading Kurdish militia in northern Syria, which Turkey regards as a terrorist group.

Now that Mr. Trump has entered office, Ankara hopes for a change in America’ policy toward the Syrian Kurds. Specifically, Mr. Erdogan wants the United States to scrap an Obama-era plan to work with Kurds to recapture Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State, and try instead with Turkish troops and Syrian Arab militias.

At the same time, Turkish officials believe the Trump administration is more likely to support extradition of Mr. Gulen and could crack down on Mr. Gulen’ supporters in the United States, where they operate a network of schools.

“opes are very high in Ankara that Turkey-U.S. relations will be much better under a Trump administration than the previous administration,”aid Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization. “rdogan does not want to endanger these two issues by speaking out against the Muslim ban.”

The meeting this past week between Mr. Erdogan and Mike Pompeo, the new head of the C.I.A., was interpreted in Turkey as a good sign —s was the phone call Wednesday between the two presidents. And Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reported that his phone conversation with Vice President Mike Pence had heralded a “ew day”n relations.

“hat we’e seeing on the ground is that Trump has stopped the plan,”r. Cevik said, referring to the Obama administration’ plan to arm the Syrian Kurds for the offensive on Raqqa. He was meeting with a New York Times journalist as Mr. Pompeo spoke to Mr. Erdogan in another part of the president’ palace. “urkey has received information that this is the case.”

But Washington insiders are more skeptical and say Turkish officials may have misplaced their hopes for specific changes in American policy in Syria.

“ don’ know why the Turks are so confident,”aid Aaron Stein, a Turkey-focused analyst at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. And James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey, said, “hey’e just not a strong enough force”o be the only American partner in Raqqa.

The phone call on Wednesday was most likely a routine conversation, Mr. Stein said, while the suspension of the Raqqa plan may yet be lifted once the Trump administration completes a 30-day review of Obama-era policies. Turkish troops and their Syrian allies, who have struggled to take the Islamic State-held city of Al Bab in recent months, may not be the best short-term partners in the fight for Raqqa.

“t’ very simple for the Trump administration,”r. Stein said by telephone. “hey can either delay the operation for Raqqa into 2018, and entertain using a Turkish force without the Y.P.G.,” reference to the Syrian Kurdish force that President Obama considered arming. “r they can go in the next six months with the Y.P.G.”

The latter seems likelier, Mr. Stein said: “ll indications are that countering the Islamic State is their priority —o that doesn’ bode well for U.S.-Turkey relations.”

Ankara’ hopes are also rooted in the widespread belief that Mr. Trump does not care about Turkey’ domestic struggles and is unlikely to lecture the government about issues like the jailing of journalists or continuing crackdowns against Gulen followers and Kurds.

“rump is not interested in Turkey’ human development or in it being a model country,”sli Aydintasbas, a prominent Turkish columnist, wrote this past week in Cumhuriyet, a secular daily newspaper. “e is looking for soldiers to fight Islamic radicalism in the region.”

On Friday, Mr. Erdogan approved plans for an April referendum in which Turks will vote on whether to grant him even greater power. While the result is still at stake, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to commit to any compromise on Syrian Kurds, as this could endanger his chances of winning the referendum, said Mr. Jeffrey, the former ambassador.

But after the referendum, Mr. Jeffrey said, “hen Erdogan may have more flexibility to accept the same or even greater role for the U.S. and the Y.P.G. —s long as he gets three things.”

According to Mr. Jeffrey, the United States would need to convince Turkey of its commitment to engagement with the Middle East, clearly demonstrate its opposition to a single Kurdish statelet along Turkey’ entire southern border and give Turkey at least a small role in the Raqqa operation.

At the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr. Cevik suggested that Turkey might tolerate some kind of Kurdish canton in northeastern Syria, but would not accept any Kurdish presence in majority-Arab areas west of the Euphrates River.

“e will knock them out from Manbij, west of Euphrates,”r. Cevik said. “e’e not going to touch them east of the Euphrates.”

Mr. Cevik added that it would also be crucial for the Syrian Kurds to distance themselves from the Kurdistan Workers’arty, or P.K.K., a Kurdish group that has waged an insurgency in southeastern Turkey for decades, and that Turkey, the United States and European countries have listed as a terrorist group.

“an’ they be another Barzani?”r. Cevik asked, referring to Masoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish region in Iraq. “arzani has excellent ties with Turkey.”

Two New York City men have pleaded guilty to federal charges that they plotted a pressure-cooker bomb attack in the city on behalf of the Islamic State, prosecutors said on Friday.

The men, Munther Omar Saleh, 21, of Queens, and Fareed Mumuni, 22, of Staten Island, were arrested in 2015.

Mr. Saleh searched online for materials needed to build a pressure-cooker bomb and looked at images of city tourist attractions in hopes of carrying out an attack, a federal complaint said. An ISIS fighter gave Mr. Mumuni the go-ahead for a suicide attack against law enforcement officers who were following the men, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement.

A police officer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey saw Mr. Saleh walking on and looking around the George Washington Bridge on two consecutive days. The authorities said he was also seen visiting a spy store in Queens and he later searched online for disguises.

Mr. Saleh was studying electrical circuitry at a college in Queens at the time of his arrest. A criminal complaint said he had translated Islamic State propaganda into English and criticized Al Qaeda as being ''too moderate.''

Mr. Saleh, Mr. Mumuni and others helped plan a New Jersey man's trip to ISIS-controlled territory, the statement said. Mr. Saleh accompanied the man, Nader Saadeh, to Kennedy International Airport, where Mr. Saadeh began his trip with a flight to Jordan. Mr. Saadeh was later arrested and pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.

Mr. Saleh pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and assaulting and conspiring to assault federal officers. Mr. Mumuni pleaded guilty on Thursday to the same charges, as well as attempted murder of federal officers. The attempted murder charge was the result of Mr. Mumuni repeatedly stabbing an F.B.I. agent in the torso with a large kitchen knife as the authorities carried out a search warrant at his home in June 2015. The agent sustained only minor injuries after the knife failed to penetrate his body armor, officials said.

Mr. Saleh faces up to 53 years in prison and Mr. Mumuni 85 years. They are scheduled to be sentenced on May 16.

Mr. Saleh is a United States citizen. Information on Mr. Mumuni's status was not available.

William F. Sweeney Jr., the assistant director in charge of the New York field office of the F.B.I., said in a statement that the ''guilty pleas show just how close the threat of homegrown terrorism exists for New York City.''

Going Home to Falluja, a City Slipping Back Into Turmoil

Times journalists are in Iraq’ Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State.

FALLUJA, Iraq —raqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go.

Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered.

Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway —e and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid.

Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq’ government could wrest one of the Islamic State’ major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk.

The Shiite-dominated national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250,000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  and ISIL.

Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed; in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers.

The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust.

Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others.

The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja’ outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad.

“f course, violations occurred in some places,”y Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells.

A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer’ battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and burned-out cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid’ home.

For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city.

“e get nothing from them but promises —e are on our own,”e said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire.

The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of bullet-pocked homes and deserted streets.

“alluja has had some hard lessons —e hope this will be our last hard lesson,”aid Sheikh Talib al-Efan, the head of Falluja’ local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way.

Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council’ makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off.

Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes —ne for each wife —ere destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend’ house since returning in August.

“eople have to expect delays,”e said. “hey need to be patient.”

The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city’ main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets.

Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency’ stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8.6 million of $18.5 million allocated — small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city.

Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq’ economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja.

Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a displaced-persons camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked —he third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said.

“e were hurt badly by Daesh,”e said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “nd now we’e being hurt by our own government.”

Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: “his area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now.”

Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, “ speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us.”

Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003.

The city was pounded during repeated battles —irst between the United States and Saddam Hussein’ forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters.

But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group’ operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja.

Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. “hey have proved very resilient,”e said.

Falluja is hardly the government’ only worry in a nation with 3.1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north.

Of the 320,000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250,000 have returned since mid-October, the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk.

In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. “e told them the risk is all theirs,”e said. “hey are responsible if anything happens, not us.”

Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: “his is incredibly worrying.”

Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a booby-trap killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said.

Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard.

A tall, gray-whiskered man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in.

Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. “’ so happy,”e told him. “t’ a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home.”

''People have to expect delays,'' he said. ''They need to be patient.''

The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city's main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets.

Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency's stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8.6 million of $18.5 million allocated -- a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city.

Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq's economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja.

Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a displaced-persons camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked -- the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said.

''We were hurt badly by Daesh,'' he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ''And now we're being hurt by our own government.''

Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: ''This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now.''

Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, ''I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us.''

Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003.

The city was pounded during repeated battles -- first between the United States and Saddam Hussein's forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters.

But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group's operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja.

Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. ''They have proved very resilient,'' he said.

Falluja is hardly the government's only worry in a nation with 3.1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north.

Of the 320,000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250,000 have returned since mid-October, the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk.

In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. ''We told them the risk is all theirs,'' he said. ''They are responsible if anything happens, not us.''

Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: ''This is incredibly worrying.''

Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a booby-trap killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said.

Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard.

A tall, gray-whiskered man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in.

Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. ''I'm so happy,'' he told him. ''It's a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home.''

Almost eight months after the recapture of Falluja, rebuilding is slow and many residents feel abandoned by the government. (PHOTOGRAPH BY SABAH ARAR/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE -- GETTY IMAGES) (A5)

Today in Mosul: Retaken Parts of  ISIS  Stronghold Return to Life

Ms. Callimachi, a Times correspondent who reports on jihadist groups, is in Iraq to cover the battle against the Islamic State.

MOSUL, Iraq -- The last time I was in Iraq, two months ago, I stood next to the highway out of the city of Mosul and watched ambulances screaming by, carrying dead and wounded soldiers.

During my reporting in Mosul this week, the picture couldn't have looked more different in the eastern half of the city, which was recently taken back by government forces. Even in places where soldiers were still partly on edge -- like above, patrolling along the banks of the Tigris River near the front line with the Islamic State -- I still was able to walk alongside them.

Driving on Thursday evening near the sprawling Nineveh International Hotel, in the northern part of the city, the streets were busy with civilian traffic, joined occasionally by an Iraqi armored vehicle.

As we drove through recently liberated areas of the city, signs of the Islamic State's occupation were everywhere. At one intersection in Al Qusoor district, a mural of the Colosseum is painted on a wall. The painted slogan repeats Islamic State's imperial promise to its followers that it will conquer Rome -- a line from the prophetic texts that animate their movement.

We easily found one of the group's abandoned weapons factories -- one of many that has been discovered in the city. Racks of mortar shells, more than a hundred in all, were stacked in neat rows. Spray-painted on the wall next to them is a memorial: ''Abu Baraa al-Ansari, conqueror of the Shia.''

Beyond the signs of the jihadists' rule, what stunned me is how quickly life has returned. A vegetable seller tended a pyramid of tomatoes. Women hailed taxis on the side of the road. A girl with blue bows in her hair played in the street with her brother.

Heading out of the city, we drove past open, and full, kebab joints, their fluorescent lights beaming out onto the street.

Craters left by airstrikes scar the streets, and some buildings have been flattened. But far more are still standing.

The retaking of the eastern side has been time-consuming for just this reason -- Iraqi forces had asked civilians to stay home rather than trying to flee. And for the most part, the soldiers have taken care to clear each block while trying to preserve infrastructure.

That is a sharp contrast -- and almost certainly a more sustainable approach -- than the scorched earth tactics used in Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar Province, or farther north in the city of Sinjar. Buildings that were still standing in Sinjar were scarred by machine gun fire, like in this image, which I took the day the city was freed in 2015.

Still, the fight for the whole city is far from over. The older parts of Mosul, west of the Tigris, are much more dense than the east. The battles to clear the parts of the city I saw today and the day before took months. The toughest part may still lie ahead.

CNN Journalist Braces for Backlash After Clash With Trump Adviser

After a contentious interview on Tuesday in which Kellyanne Conway, the presidential adviser, and Jake Tapper of CNN clashed over whether the White House or the news media was more indifferent to facts, the journalist was bracing on Wednesday for a backlash from the right.

While the 25-minute interview touched on issues like the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary and President Trump's relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the bulk of it focused on Mr. Trump's criticism of the media and the administration's penchant for repeating falsehoods.

The interview was frequently testy, and Mr. Tapper's performance was widely praised by those seeking a more aggressive approach to fact-checking the Trump administration.

[Video: Kellyanne Conway's full interview with Jake Tapper Watch on YouTube.]

But then Axios, citing an anonymous source, reported that Mr. Tapper would now likely be a target for ''hit pieces'' from at least one conservative news site. The New York Times was unable to independently verify the report.

Mr. Tapper appeared to welcome the critics, posting on Twitter that he would just wait for ''attack dogs'' to come at him.

So now we sit and wait to see which obedient attack dog follows orders. Arf arf!! https://t.co/GXBrHDblQp -- Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 8, 2017

Ms. Conway's CNN appearance came amid growing questions about her credibility after she falsely spoke of a ''Bowling Green massacre'' that never happened and used the phrase ''alternative facts'' to justify the administration's view of the truth. She repeatedly corrected the Bowling Green error and apologized for it on Tuesday, but reports later emerged that she had previously invoked the nonexistent episode in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine (which did not print the quotation) and with TMZ.

Some critics are calling on cable news outlets to bar her from appearing on air, and CNN declined to have her on as a guest Sunday.

Mr. Trump added to tension with the press by accusing news organizations of playing down or declining to cover terrorist attacks. The White House on Monday issued a list of what it said were 78 underreported attacks; but several news organizations, including CNN and The Times, provided evidence to the contrary.

On Tuesday, Ms. Conway questioned the focus and tone of more recent news coverage. Without citing examples, she criticized descriptions of Mr. Trump that lacked ''a certain respect for and recognition of the dignity for the office of the president.''

She asked for ''more complete coverage'' of Mr. Trump's executive orders, instead of a focus on the travel ban affecting seven Muslim-majority countries.

Mr. Tapper countered that the executive order had caused chaos at airports across the globe and was a major story deserving coverage. He added that Mr. Trump has also spread false information that the president accuses the media of not reporting.

In one example cited by Mr. Tapper, Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that the murder rate was ''the highest it's been in 47 years'' and that ''the press doesn't tell it like it is.'' The facts: While the rate spiked in 2015, multiple fact-checks found that the murder rate is actually near a 45-year low.

''Facts are stubborn things,'' Mr. Tapper said, ''and to say that we're not reporting something that happens not to be true, therefore we're not to be trusted, that's a problem.''

When Ms. Conway suggested that the media had played down some attacks because people had become ''inured to terrorist attacks,'' Mr. Tapper protested.

''Well, your spin about the idea that we don't want to be inured to that, that's a lovely spin, but that's not what he was saying, Kellyanne,'' he said. ''He was saying the media does not cover these stories because we don't want to cover them because we have some sort of agenda.''

''That's what he was suggesting,'' he added, ''and it's offensive given the fact that CNN and other media organizations have reporters in danger right now in war zones covering ISIS, and I just don't understand how the president can make an attack like that.''

On Wednesday, after the report that he would be targeted, Mr. Tapper appeared to be enjoying the #TapperDirtFile Twitter hashtag that had been created in his honor. Users professed to expose damaging, but made-up, tidbits to be used in a hit piece about him, such as liking Nickelback or the time he ordered a ''large coffee'' at Starbucks.

He even added his own ''dirt'' on Twitter, posting that he listened to the Billy Joel Channel on SiriusXM radio and that he had seen every ''Final Destination'' movie -- ''Yes, all five of them.''

 ISIS  Detainees May Be Held at Guantáamo, Document Shows

WASHINGTON -- The Trump White House is nearing completion of an order that would direct the Pentagon to bring future Islamic State detainees to the Guantáamo Bay prison, despite warnings from national security officials and legal scholars that doing so risks undermining the effort to combat the group, according to administration officials and a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times.

White House officials have detailed their thinking about a new detainee policy in an evolving series of drafts of an executive order being circulated among national security officials for comment. While previous versions have shown that the draft has undergone many changes -- including dropping language about reviving C.I.A. prisons -- the plan to add Islamic State detainees to the Guantáamo population has remained constant.

The latest version of the draft, which circulated this week, would direct Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to use Guantáamo to detain suspected members of ''Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including individuals and networks associated with the Islamic State.''

The White House has kept similar language in the draft order despite warnings from career government national security officials that carrying out its plan would give federal judges an opportunity to reject the executive branch's theory that the war against the Islamic State is legal, even though Congress never explicitly authorized it. The issue could arise when reviewing an inevitable habeas corpus lawsuit filed by an ISIS detainee.

The Obama administration first argued in late summer 2014 that the Islamic State was part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized in 2001 against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But while the Islamic State got its start as Al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq more than a decade ago, that theory is disputed because the two groups later split and went to war with each other.

''It raises huge legal risks,'' said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official in the Bush administration. ''If a judge says the Sept. 11 authorization does not cover such a detention, it would not only make that detention unlawful, it would weaken the legal basis for the entire war against the Islamic State.''

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the issue.

The Times reported on Feb. 4 that the White House had limited the draft order so that it focused on carrying out President Trump's vow to keep the Guantáamo prison open and use it for newly captured detainees. That draft of the order dropped the ideas of reopening C.I.A. prisons and permitting interrogators to use harsher techniques than those now allowed in the Army Field Manual.

That report was based on accounts by people familiar with a version that circulated last week. But a new draft order circulated this week, titled ''Protecting America Through Lawful Detention of Terrorist and Other Designated Enemy Elements,'' includes some revisions. The latest version, unlike the previous one, explicitly revokes President Barack Obama's January 2009 executive order directing the government to close the prison by January 2010, a deadline it failed to meet.

The revised text also dropped references to revitalizing the use of the military commissions system at Guantáamo for prosecuting terrorism suspects, and instead focused exclusively on detention policy -- like its directive to use the prison to detain captured Islamic State suspects without trial.

In the 2012 version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, Congress bolstered the government's power to imprison suspected members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated forces by authorizing such detentions without reference to the Sept. 11 attacks. But while it has provided funds for military operations against the Islamic State, it has never explicitly authorized combat or detention operations against it.

In summer 2014, when the group swept out of Syria and began rapidly conquering swaths of Iraq, Mr. Obama launched a bombing campaign to curtail its advances. At the time, he put forth the theory that the group's early ties to Al Qaeda were sufficient to bring it under the Sept. 11 war authorization without new action from Congress.

Nevertheless, in 2015, the Obama administration asked Congress to enact an authorization for use of military force against the Islamic State. Lawmakers disagreed about whether it should place limits on the use of ground forces or impose an expiration date, and Congress never acted on the proposal. Congress has continued to give no sign that it has the will or the consensus to explicitly authorize war on the Islamic State.

Last year, an army captain sued Mr. Obama, arguing that the war was illegal because Congress had not authorized it. A Federal District Court judge dismissed the lawsuit without ruling on the legal merits, saying the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the case.

But any Islamic State detainee at Guantáamo would have legal standing to get a court to rule on the question of whether the group is legitimately part of the war against Al Qaeda.

Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor who worked at the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said there were other reasons bringing an Islamic State detainee to Guantáamo for indefinite detention, as opposed to prosecuting him in civilian court, might raise problems: Foreign allies, he said, might refuse to turn over prisoners or assist in detention operations if that was the administration's goal.

But even if that turns out not to be the case, he said, the legal risks of bringing a suspected member of the Islamic State, sometimes referred to as ISIL, are ''very serious.''

''If I were in the administration, I would advise that bringing ISIL fighters to Guantáamo raises too many legal risks,'' he said. ''If a court finds the 2001 statute does not apply to ISIL because of the extraordinarily remote links between ISIL and the original Al Qaeda, then it would put into legal jeopardy the executive branch's basis for lethal operations as well as detention operations.''

Arizona Man Gets 30 Years for Aiding  ISIS -Inspired Texas Attack

An Arizona man was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Wednesday for aiding the Islamic State by helping two followers who attacked an anti-Islam event in Texas, leading to a deadly shootout with the police.

Prosecutors were seeking a 50-year sentence for the man, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, an American-born Muslim convert who became the second person in the United States to be convicted on charges of supporting the Islamic State. He was convicted of conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organization, interstate transportation of firearms and other charges.

His friends Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were the only ones killed in the May 2015 shootout outside a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Tex. A security guard was wounded. The contest featured images that are offensive to Muslims.

The authorities said Mr. Kareem had watched videos depicting violence by jihadists with the two friends, encouraged them to carry out a violent attack, and researched travel to the Middle East to join Islamic State fighters.

''He knew what Mr. Simpson and Soofi intended to do,'' Federal District Judge Susan R. Bolton said.

Mr. Kareem kept his head down as the sentence was announced. ''I had nothing to do with this crime,'' he told the judge.

His lawyer, Daniel Maynard, acknowledged that his client had associated with people who had radical political views, but underscored that Mr. Kareem was in Arizona at the time of the attack.

A prosecutor, Kristen Brook, said Mr. Kareem had actively assisted in an attempted mass murder. ''The offense was ideologically fueled hatred,'' she said.

Mr. Kareem testified that he had not known his friends were going to attack the contest and did not find out about the shooting until after Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi were killed.

He told jurors last year that he disapproved of Mr. Simpson's using Mr. Kareem's laptop to watch Qaeda promotional materials.

Afghan Attack Kills Red Cross Workers

KABUL, Afghanistan -- Six employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross were killed and two others were missing on Wednesday after an attack in northern Afghanistan that officials attributed to local affiliates of the Islamic State.

''This is a despicable act. Nothing can justify the murder of our colleagues and dear friends,'' Monica Zanarelli, the head of the Red Cross delegation in Afghanistan, said. ''At this point, it's premature for us to determine the impact of this appalling incident on our operations in Afghanistan.''

The Taliban, who still inflict the largest share of violence in a 15-year war that has escalated in recent years, quickly denied that they were behind the attack.

The Red Cross has a 30-year history of helping war victims in Afghanistan, providing crucial medical aid to areas near the battlefield, among other things. The insurgency also relies on Red Cross volunteers to retrieve the bodies of its dead in large parts of the country and to help families of its detainees communicate with them in prison.

But in a recent report, the Red Cross expressed concerns about ''the shrinking access of humanitarian aid workers in numerous parts of the country'' because of ''the intensification of conflict-related violence.''

The governor of Jowzjan Province, Lutfullah Azizi, blamed affiliates of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, for the attack.

Mr. Azizi said that the Red Cross had begun a mission to distribute livestock material in the Qush Tepah area of Jowzjan Province, where the attack happened, but that its work was paused by recent avalanches. When workers went to resume giving out aid, they were targeted.

''They were a team of eight people in three vehicles, including three drivers and five staff,'' Mr. Azizi said. ''Islamic State attacked the convoy, killed the three drivers and three staff members on the spot and took two staff members with them.''

Mr. Azizi said Qush Tepah, about 37 miles from the provincial capital, is rife with militant groups, including five Islamic State factions with about 200 fighters total.

Officials and analysts were conflicted about the Islamic State's initial forays in Afghanistan. Beginning in 2015, Pakistanis and Afghans who were former Taliban members started wreaking havoc, claiming affiliation to the terrorist group. Major military operations were started to keep the Islamic State's foothold mostly restricted to several districts in eastern provinces.

Over the last year, the concern about the group has increased as it has claimed some deadly suicide attacks in urban centers. The United Nations said that in 2016 there was a tenfold jump in civilian casualties caused in attacks claimed by the Islamic State.

The group issued a statement on Wednesday claiming the latest deadly attack in Kabul, which killed at least 21 people near the country's Supreme Court.

In recent weeks, officials in northern Afghanistan also have expressed concern about an increase in foreign fighters there, many of them suspected of affiliation with the Islamic State.

Sarwar Hussaini, a spokesman for the northern police zone, said there were about 600 foreign fighters in five northern provinces.

''They are fighting for both the Islamic State and the Taliban, as well as some other terrorist group,'' Mr. Hussaini said. ''The foreign fighter started coming to the north of Afghanistan about three years ago, and now we are worried about the number of foreign fighters who are active here.''

Battle to Retake Syrian City Turns Into a Geopolitical Test of the War

BEIRUT, Lebanon — northern Syrian city that is one of the Islamic State’ last enclaves in the country is under assault by military forces bearing down from all sides.

The complication is that the advancing forces —he Syrian Army and pro-government militias backed by Russia, and Syrian rebels backed by Turkey —re sworn enemies.

Their simultaneous race to seize the city, Al Bab, has turned into a test of how a global realignment of powers supporting Syria’ antagonists could help reshape or end the nearly six-year-old conflict.

Al Bab, which had roughly 100,000 people when the war began in 2011, is the last urban area held by the Islamic State west of its de facto capital, Raqqa, where the group remains entrenched.

Russia and Turkey have swerved in recent months from outright hostility to working more closely in a diplomatic effort aimed at resolving the conflict, after fitful and repeated failures led by the United Nations and the United States.

But in the battle for Al Bab, Russia and Turkey must transform their newfound understanding into results on the ground, with the ambitious goal of pushing their Syrian partners into de facto military cooperation. Otherwise they risk creating a new flash point.

The coming days will show if the Syrian foes, who do not always obey their patrons, will work together for the first time against the Islamic State, or drive out the extremists and then try to kill one another.

The answers could shed light on whether Russia and Turkey have the leverage to push the opposing Syrian sides into substantive negotiations and real change.

As of Wednesday, they appeared to be partly succeeding. Russian and Turkish state-affiliated news media said that Turkey and Russia had been coordinating to prevent clashes outside Al Bab, and Syrian fighters on the ground confirmed the coordination.

These developments come amid a broader geopolitical reordering of the participants in the tangled Syria conflict. After the government’ crushing victory over rebel fighters in the city of Aleppo late last year, and the election of President Trump, who has called for closer American-Russian coordination, Russia has accelerated efforts to lead international diplomacy on Syria.

There are high hopes in Damascus that the United States will move closer to a de facto alliance with Russia in Syria and abandon its military support for groups seeking the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.

But major questions remain, particularly concerning Mr. Trump, who has sent conflicting signals. He has suggested he will pay less attention to what many rights advocates have described as Mr. Assad’ brutality, and more on working with Russia on counterterrorism. At the same time Mr. Trump has begun to escalate tensions with Iran, the Syrian government’ other main backer and closest ally.

Turkish statements on Wednesday suggested the prospect of increased, if indirect, coordination between the United States and Russia, given the increased cooperation between Turkey and Russia.

Turkey’ state-run Anadolu news agency reported that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Mr. Trump had agreed in a phone call on Tuesday night to “ct together”n the Al Bab battle as well as in a coming fight for Raqqa.

But the White House —n the eve of a visit to Turkey by the new C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo —id not emphasize Al Bab, saying only that Mr. Trump had promised Mr. Erdogan that the United States would continue cooperating against the Islamic State.

Either way, the tempo of airstrikes by the American-led coalition against Islamic State targets around Al Bab has increased in recent days, with six strikes reported by the military on Tuesday alone, and 35 since Jan. 1.

Both pro- and anti-government forces expect to take advantage, vowing to seize Al Bab within days, fighters and supporters say.

Russia and Turkey have agreed that the pro-government forces, not the rebels, will enter the city, according to two government supporters with knowledge of the plans. Otherwise, they said, the rebels —ho have pressed Al Bab on three sides for months —ould have seized it long ago.

One of these people is an army soldier fighting there. The other is a pro-government informant from Al Bab, who now lives outside Syria but has relayed information to the Syrian military from his contacts in the city. Both were reached via internet chat and requested anonymity because they were not authorized to communicate with reporters.

Russia insisted on the terms for occupying Al Bab in a deal reached last month in Astana, Kazakhstan, according to the informant, who said Russia wanted pro-government forces to take the city in part to seize water facilities that could help alleviate shortages.

But it remains unclear if all rebel forces backed by Turkey in the Al Bab siege have accepted those terms. Some stepped up their assault on Wednesday and vowed to take the city first.

Allowing pro-government forces to occupy Al Bab could be humiliating for the rebels before a new round of peace talks scheduled to start on Feb. 20 in Geneva. But with shrinking options, the rebels are increasingly wedded to the wishes of their Turkish backers.

Other military moves offer more clues to how the United States and others are approaching the battleground shifts.

To the east of Al Bab, a mix of Kurdish and Arab militias have been advancing in an attempt to encircle Raqqa. In anticipation of an assault on the city, the United States said it would add 200 American military advisers aiding the forces dominated by Kurds. The addition, approved under Mr. Trump, has reinforced an Obama administration policy that infuriated Turkey —hich sees the Kurds as its main enemy —ven as Mr. Trump seeks to improve relations with Mr. Erdogan.

A high-level Turkish delegation is expected to visit Washington next week to discuss military options for recapturing Raqqa. A senior Turkish official, who disclosed the visit, suggested one option would be reassigning many of the Syrian Army troops in the Al Bab siege to the fight in Raqqa instead. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military strategy, reiterated Turkey’ strong objection to the American plan for Kurds to be part of a Raqqa offensive.

To the southeast, in Deir al-Zour, the Islamic State’ other Syrian territory, both the government and the opposition are trying to organize new Arab forces to fight the extremist group, with Russia and the United States maneuvering for leadership.

American-led airstrikes appear to be increasing in Idlib, the northwestern province where non-Islamic State fighters and opposition activists have cloistered, after being displaced elsewhere by government advances.

Airstrikes in recent months have hit not only fighters linked to Al Qaeda but also some members of rebel groups working with them, a practice long followed by Russia but opposed by the United States. While it is not clear whose warplanes carried out every strike, they are seen as blurring the distinction between American and Russian air operations.

On Tuesday, an aerial assault in Idlib that residents described as a mix of ballistic missiles and airstrikes destroyed a residential building, killing at least 46 people, including women and children.

In southern Syria, American-backed rebels have agreed to a new truce with government forces. The agreement followed the Astana talks, where rebel leaders expanded their discussions with Russian officials, with some later visiting Moscow.

Taken together, the developments point toward a gradual albeit unsteady reconciliation between the American and Russian objectives in Syria. But major diplomatic obstacles remain.

Mr. Assad will not necessarily agree with what Russia wants of him —ome power sharing and a constitution that diminishes presidential authority. His main backer, Iran, takes a harder line in favor of preserving his power.

And as the Trump administration moves closer to Russia’ Syria policy, rights groups and other critics say the United States risks complicity with Syrian government abuses.

This week, Amnesty International released a report saying that thousands had been summarily executed in Syrian prisons, and international weapons inspectors reported a new instance of chlorine bomb use by the government, despite its 2013 agreement to renounce such weapons.

Still, some analysts say Russia appears to be the only participant willing and able to even try to bring the conflict to a resolution.

Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk assessment firm in Washington, and a former State Department official, said Russia’ approach was “he worst conceivable plan, except for any other.”

Connecting Trump’ Dots; Op-Ed Columnist

Every day, the president’ behavior becomes more worrying. One day he demeans a federal judge who challenges him; the next day, without evidence, he accuses the media of hiding illegal voting or acts of terrorism. His lack of respect for institutions and truth pours out so fast, you start to forget how crazy this behavior is for any adult, let alone a president, and just how ugly things will get when we have a real crisis. And crises are baked into this story because of the incoherence of President Trump’ worldview.

How so? The world today is more interdependent than ever. The globalization of markets, the spread of cellphones, the accelerations in technology and biology, the new mass movements of migrants and the disruptions in the climate are all intertwined and impacting one another. As a result, we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst.

But Trump is a dot exploiter, not connector. He made a series of reckless, unconnected promises, not much longer than tweets, to get elected, and now he’ just checking off each one, without thinking through the linkages among them or anticipating second-order effects.

It is a great way to make America weak —nd overstretched —gain.

Where do I start? Trump wants to get tougher with China on trade and security. That’ not crazy. But how would I do that? I’ organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values —s opposed to China’. I’ call it the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short.

Oh wait, President Barack Obama did that, but Trump scrapped TPP on Day 1, without, I am sure, having read it. Now there is every reason to believe our Asian-Pacific allies will fall even more under China’ economic sway and trade “ules.”ow smart is that?

And by the way, why is labor in Mexico cheaper than in America? One reason is that Mexico has weaker labor rights and environmental standards. Let’ see …hat would TPP require of Mexico and other signatories? That they bring their labor rights and environmental standards closer to ours.

Instead, Trump is building a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants and force companies to move to the U.S. Let’ see …hat happened after 9/11, when the border crossings with Mexico and Canada were severely constricted for security? It forced some assembly line shutdowns at U.S. auto companies, like Ford, because their supply chains stretched to Mexico and Canada. The lower-cost work is done in Mexico and then integrated with higher-value-added work in America, which enables our car companies to compete on price in Europe, Japan and China.

So what did the U.S., Canada and Mexico do after 9/11? They created a North American security envelope, explained Seth Stodder, Obama’ assistant secretary of homeland security, so if you fly into Mexico or Toronto from the Middle East, our Homeland Security Department now probably knows about it.

“ince 9/11, we and our Mexican and Canadian partners have worked to secure the North American perimeter by sharing information on people and goods coming to our countries, cross-referencing that information against terrorism databases and working collaboratively to identify potential bad actors trying to come to North America,”todder said. If we build a wall and demand that Mexico pay for it, how long will it go on cooperating with us?

And if Trump forces all these U.S.-based multinationals to move operations from Mexico back to the U.S., what will that do? Help tank the Mexican economy so more Mexicans will try to come north, and raise the costs for U.S. manufacturers. What will they do? Move their factories to the U.S. but replace as many humans as possible with robots to contain costs.

The U.N. says there’ a record 65 million displaced migrants and refugees, mostly from the developing world, trying to get into secure places like the U.S. or Europe. Why? A mix of civil wars, state failures, climate stresses and population explosions. What did Trump do his first week? Appoint climate deniers to key posts and ban U.S. aid to health groups that provide abortion as a family-planning option in developing nations.

Trump wants to partner with Vladimir Putin to defeat \b ISIS\b0  in Syria — worthy goal. But Putin hasn’ been trying to defeat ISIS. He’ been trying to defeat democracy in Syria to keep the genocidal pro-Russian dictator there in power.

Will that be our goal, too? And who are Putin’ allies in Syria? Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite mercenaries from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will they be our allies, too? No. We will enlist Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis to help us, says Trump. Really? But he just barred them from entering the U.S. How cooperative will they be?

And whom else might this ban keep out? Remember Steve Jobs? His biological father was Abdulfattah “ohn”andali. He came to America as a student in the 1950s and studied at the University of Wisconsin. He was from …oms, Syria.

It’ amazing what a mess you can make when you only check boxes and don’ link them.

Battle to Retake Syrian City Turns Into a Geopolitical Test of the War

BEIRUT, Lebanon —n isolated northern Syrian city that is one of the Islamic State’ last remaining enclaves in the country is under assault by military forces bearing down from all sides.

The complication is that the advancing forces —he Syrian Army and pro-government militias backed by Russia, and Syrian rebels backed by Turkey —re sworn enemies.

Their simultaneous race to seize the city, Al Bab, has turned into a test of how a global realignment of powers supporting Syria’ antagonists could help reshape or end the nearly six-year-old conflict.

Russia and Turkey have swerved in recent months from outright hostility to working more closely in a diplomatic effort aimed at resolving the conflict, after fitful and repeated failures led by the United Nations and the United States.

But in the battle for Al Bab, Russia and Turkey must transform their newfound understanding into results on the ground, with the ambitious goal of pushing their Syrian partners into de facto military cooperation. Otherwise they risk creating a new flash point.

The coming days will show if the Syrian foes, who do not always obey their patrons, will work together for the first time against the Islamic State, or drive out the extremists and then try to kill one another.

The answers could shed light on whether Russia and Turkey have the leverage to push the opposing Syrian sides into substantive negotiations and real change.

As of Wednesday, they appeared to be partly succeeding. Russian and Turkish state-affiliated news media said that Turkey and Russia had been coordinating to prevent clashes outside Al Bab, and Syrian fighters on the ground confirmed the coordination.

These developments come amid a broader geopolitical reordering of the participants in the tangled Syria conflict. After the government’ crushing victory over rebel fighters in the city of Aleppo late last year, and the election of President Trump, who has called for closer American-Russian coordination, Russia has accelerated efforts to lead international diplomacy on Syria.

There are high hopes in Damascus that the United States will move closer to a de facto alliance with Russia in Syria, and abandon its military support for groups seeking the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.

But major questions remain, particularly concerning Mr. Trump, who has sent conflicting signals. He has suggested he will pay less attention to what many rights advocates have described as Mr. Assad’ brutality, and more on working with Russia on counterterrorism. At the same time Mr. Trump has begun to escalate tensions with Iran, the Syrian government’ other main backer and closest ally.

Turkish statements on Wednesday suggested the prospect of increased, if indirect, coordination between the United States and Russia, given the increased cooperation between Turkey and Russia.

Turkey’ state-run Anadolu news agency reported that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Mr. Trump had agreed in a phone call on Tuesday night to “ct together”n the Al Bab battle as well as in a coming fight for the eastern Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’ de facto capital.

 ISIS  Detainees May Be Held at Guantáamo, Document Shows

WASHINGTON —he Trump White House is nearing completion of an order that would direct the Pentagon to bring future Islamic State detainees to the Guantáamo Bay prison, despite warnings from national security officials and legal scholars that doing so risks undermining the effort to combat the group, according to administration officials and a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times.

White House officials have spelled out their thinking about a new detainee policy in an evolving series of drafts of an executive order being circulated among national security officials for comment. While previous versions have shown that the draft has undergone many changes –ncluding dropping language about reviving C.I.A. prisons –he plan to add Islamic State detainees to the Guantáamo population has remained constant.

The latest version of the draft, which circulated this week, would direct Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to use Guantáamo to detain suspected members of “l Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including individuals and networks associated with the Islamic State.”

The White House has kept similar language in the draft order despite warnings from career government national security officials that carrying out its plan would give federal judges an opportunity to reject the executive branch’ theory that the war against the Islamic State is legal, even though Congress never explicitly authorized it. The issue could arise when reviewing an inevitable habeas corpus lawsuit filed by an ISIS detainee.

The Obama administration first argued in late summer 2014 that the Islamic State was part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized in 2001 against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But while the Islamic State got its start as Al Qaeda’ affiliate in Iraq a decade ago, that theory is disputed because the two groups later split and went to war with each other.

“t raises huge legal risks,”aid Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official in the Bush administration. “f a judge says the Sept. 11 authorization does not cover such a detention, it would not only make that detention unlawful, it would weaken the legal basis for the entire war against the Islamic State.”

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the issue.

The Times reported on Feb. 4 that the White House had limited the draft order so that it focused on carrying out President Trump’ vow to keep the Guantáamo prison open and use it for newly captured detainees. That draft of the order dropped the ideas of reopening C.I.A. prisons and permitting interrogators to use harsher techniques than those now allowed in the Army Field Manual.

That report was based on accounts by people familiar with a version that circulated last week. But a new draft order circulated this week, titled “rotecting America Through Lawful Detention of Terrorist and Other Designated Enemy Elements,”ncludes some revisions. The latest version, unlike the previous one, explicitly revokes President Barack Obama’ January 2009 executive order directing the government to close the prison by January 2010, a deadline it failed to meet.

The revised text also dropped references to revitalizing the use of the military commissions system at Guantáamo for prosecuting terrorism suspects, and instead focused exclusively on detention policy —ike its directive to use the prison to detain captured Islamic State suspects without trial.

In the 2012 version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, Congress bolstered the government’ power to imprison suspected members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated forces by authorizing such detentions without reference to the Sept. 11 attacks. But while it has provided funds for military operations against the Islamic State, it has never explicitly authorized combat or detention operations against it.

In summer 2014, when the group swept out of Syria and began rapidly conquering swaths of Iraq, Mr. Obama launched a bombing campaign to curtail its advances. At the time, he put forth the theory that the group’ early ties to Al Qaeda were sufficient to bring it under the Sept. 11 war authorization without new action from Congress.

Nevertheless, in 2015, the Obama administration asked Congress to enact an authorization for use of military force against the Islamic State. Lawmakers disagreed about whether it should place limits on the use of ground forces or impose an expiration date, and Congress never acted on the proposal. Congress has continued to give no sign that it has the will or the consensus to explicitly authorize war on the Islamic State.

Last year, an army captain sued Mr. Obama, arguing that the war was illegal because Congress had not authorized it. A Federal District Court judge dismissed the lawsuit without ruling on the legal merits, saying the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the case.

But any Islamic State detainee at Guantáamo would have legal standing to get a court to rule on the question of whether the group State is legitimately part of the war against Al Qaeda.

Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor who worked at the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said were other reasons bringing an Islamic State detainee to Guantáamo for indefinite detention, as opposed to prosecuting him in civilian court, might raise problems: Foreign allies, he said, might refuse to turn over prisoners or assist in detention operations if that was the administration’ goal.

But even if that turns out not to be the case, he said, the legal risks of bringing a suspected member of the Islamic State, sometimes referred to as ISIL, are “ery serious.”

“f I were in the administration, I would advise that bringing ISIL fighters to Guantáamo raises too many legal risks,”e said. “f a court finds the 2001 statute does not apply to ISIL because of the extraordinarily remote links between ISIL and the original Al Qaeda, then it would put into legal jeopardy the executive branch’ basis for lethal operations as well as detention operations.”

Our Articles on the Attacks Trump Says the Media Didn't Cover

The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks, saying most were underreported. The Trump administration, under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies it says are designed to curb terrorism, has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat.

But the list, which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016, includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media, including by The New York Times. (Examples are included in the list below.)

Just as striking was what the list excluded: attacks targeting Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism.

The list does not mention, for instance, two suicide bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed dozens in November 2015, or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria, which have been among the world's deadliest terrorist assaults.

Though there have been many attacks in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the list mentions only one: a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors. The list describes the target as ''a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards,'' which is correct but in keeping with the document's emphasis on Western targets -- a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow.

Prominent attacks carried out by non-Muslims are also conspicuously omitted. In June 2015, Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston, S.C., killing nine. That November, three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs. Robert L. Dear Jr., describing himself as a ''warrior for the babies,'' acknowledged that he had carried out the attack, but he was later declared mentally unfit to stand trial.

Right-wing violence has been rising in the United States, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation, and has in some years claimed more lives than Islamist attacks in the country.

The White House's list, by focusing on a significant but narrow slice of terrorism, feeds into perceptions that the administration is seeking to target Muslims with other policies, particularly its immigration restrictions against predominantly Muslim countries.

Every day, the president's behavior becomes more worrying. One day he demeans a federal judge who challenges him; the next day, without evidence, he accuses the media of hiding illegal voting or acts of terrorism. His lack of respect for institutions and truth pours out so fast, you start to forget how crazy this behavior is for any adult, let alone a president, and just how ugly things will get when we have a real crisis. And crises are baked into this story because of the incoherence of President Trump's worldview.

How so? The world today is more interdependent than ever. The globalization of markets, the spread of cellphones, the accelerations in technology and biology, the new mass movements of migrants and the disruptions in the climate are all intertwined and impacting one another. As a result, we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst.

But Trump is a dot exploiter, not connector. He made a series of reckless, unconnected promises, not much longer than tweets, to get elected, and now he's just checking off each one, without thinking through the linkages among them or anticipating second-order effects.

It is a great way to make America weak -- and overstretched -- again.

Where do I start? Trump wants to get tougher with China on trade and security. That's not crazy. But how would I do that? I'd organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values -- as opposed to China's. I'd call it the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short.

Oh wait, President Barack Obama did that, but Trump scrapped TPP on Day 1, without, I am sure, having read it. Now there is every reason to believe our Asian-Pacific allies will fall even more under China's economic sway and trade ''rules.'' How smart is that?

And by the way, why is labor in Mexico cheaper than in America? One reason is that Mexico has weaker labor rights and environmental standards. Let's see ... what would TPP require of Mexico and other signatories? That they bring their labor rights and environmental standards closer to ours.

Instead, Trump is building a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants and force companies to move to the U.S. Let's see ... what happened after 9/11, when the border crossings with Mexico and Canada were severely constricted for security? It forced some assembly line shutdowns at U.S. auto companies, like Ford, because their supply chains stretched to Mexico and Canada. The lower-cost work is done in Mexico and then integrated with higher-value-added work in America, which enables our car companies to compete on price in Europe, Japan and China.

So what did the U.S., Canada and Mexico do after 9/11? They created a North American security envelope, explained Seth Stodder, Obama's assistant secretary of homeland security, so if you fly into Mexico or Toronto from the Middle East, our Homeland Security Department now probably knows about it.

''Since 9/11, we and our Mexican and Canadian partners have worked to secure the North American perimeter by sharing information on people and goods coming to our countries, cross-referencing that information against terrorism databases and working collaboratively to identify potential bad actors trying to come to North America,'' Stodder said. If we build a wall and demand that Mexico pay for it, how long will it go on cooperating with us?

And if Trump forces all these U.S.-based multinationals to move operations from Mexico back to the U.S., what will that do? Help tank the Mexican economy so more Mexicans will try to come north, and raise the costs for U.S. manufacturers. What will they do? Move their factories to the U.S. but replace as many humans as possible with robots to contain costs.

The U.N. says there's a record 65 million displaced migrants and refugees, mostly from the developing world, trying to get into secure places like the U.S. or Europe. Why? A mix of civil wars, state failures, climate stresses and population explosions. What did Trump do his first week? Appoint climate deniers to key posts and ban U.S. aid to health groups that provide abortion as a family-planning option in developing nations.

Trump wants to partner with Vladimir Putin to defeat ISIS in Syria -- a worthy goal. But Putin hasn't been trying to defeat ISIS. He's been trying to defeat democracy in Syria to keep the genocidal pro-Russian dictator there in power.

Will that be our goal, too? And who are Putin's allies in Syria? Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite mercenaries from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will they be our allies, too? No. We will enlist Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis to help us, says Trump. Really? But he just barred them from entering the U.S. How cooperative will they be?

And whom else might this ban keep out? Remember Steve Jobs? His biological father was Abdulfattah ''John'' Jandali. He came to America as a student in the 1950s and studied at the University of Wisconsin. He was from ... Homs, Syria.

It's amazing what a mess you can make when you only check boxes and don't link them.

 ISIS  Redoubt in Syria Is Said to Be Nearly Encircled

An important northern Syrian city held by the Islamic State, the group's last major outpost in the region, was practically surrounded Monday by pro-government and insurgent forces squeezing it from different directions, according to rebels and the state-run Syrian news media.

The city -- Al Bab, in Aleppo Province, 15 miles south of the Turkish border -- has been hemmed in for months by insurgent fighters and Turkish troops, who have together blocked approaches from the east, north and west, according to rebels working with Turkey, as well as local activists and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.

But now the Syrian Army, aided by Hezbollah militia fighters and artillery units supplied by Russia, has cut off the approach to Al Bab from the south, the Syrian Observatory said Monday. The state-run news media corroborated its account, saying the pro-government forces had captured a hill overlooking a southeastern route out of Al Bab, the last road not already blocked by the Turkish troops and rebels.

Although the Turkish-backed insurgents and Russian-backed government forces are not openly coordinating their moves -- and in other circumstances, might be attacking each other -- the joint encirclement of Al Bab appeared to reflect a strategic desire to rout the Islamic State, a group that both parties describe as an enemy.

Turkey and Russia are also pressing ahead with diplomatic cooperation, with the goal of expanding a partial truce and bringing the Syrian antagonists into a new round of peace talks.

But as the antagonists get closer to Al Bab, the encirclement could become a flash point. If Islamic State fighters flee, pro- and antigovernment forces could find themselves facing each other across an unpredictable new front line.

While Russia and Turkey have begun to coordinate air operations in northern Syria in some instances, there have been no reports of coordination on the ground.

Al Bab is one of the largest urban areas in central northern Syria, after Aleppo, the city retaken from rebel groups by Syrian forces, with Russian help, nearly two months ago. Since then, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has focused more military resources on fighting the Islamic State, particularly in Palmyra, the ancient city that the group captured in May 2015, lost last March and recaptured in December.

If the Islamic State is defeated in Al Bab, it will lose its last piece of territory in Aleppo Province, where it once held large areas. That would winnow the group's significant Syrian territory to areas around Raqqa, its self-declared capital farther east.

That possibility has elevated the importance of Al Bab to all sides in the conflict, which is nearly six years old.

The Syrian Army's occupation of the southern approach to Al Bab gives it control of ''the only and last main road used by the jihadists between Al Bab and Raqqa,'' said the Syrian Observatory, which bases its reporting on a network of contacts on the ground.

Turkey and Russia are working to advance peace talks on Syria, although they support opposite sides. A brief round of talks held last month in Astana, Kazakhstan, is set to resume this month in Geneva. The Islamic State and extremist militant factions tied to Al Qaeda are excluded.

The Islamic State is increasingly under assault in Syria and Iraq, where an American-backed military effort to evict the group from the northern city of Mosul has been underway for months. Roughly half the city has been retaken.

In a report issued on Monday, the United Nations said the Islamic State had been further constrained by declines in revenue from its oil-smuggling and extortion businesses, as well as fewer recruits.

The report said the group was ''militarily on the defensive in several regions, notably in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and the Syrian Arab Republic.''

Nonetheless, it cautioned, the Islamic State has partly adapted and ''continues to encourage its followers and sympathizers outside conflict zones to perpetrate attacks.''

Ex-Officials Join Fight Against Travel Ban

A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump's travel ban, saying the White House executive order would ''endanger U.S. troops'' and disrupt antiterrorism efforts.

The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States.

With Mr. Trump's executive order, ''we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message'' to Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. ''The order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,'' it said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C.I.A.

The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump's order, saying in a statement that he ''fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.''

The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration: that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from ''very bad and dangerous people,'' as Mr. Trump has put it.

Noting that the 10 signatories to the filing ''have all held the highest security clearances,'' the letter asserts that Mr. Trump's order ''ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer.''

The travel ban was dealt a stinging setback on Friday, when a federal judge in Seattle issued the broadest ruling to date blocking major parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed Saturday, leaving the issue in the hands of the court in San Francisco.

After the appeals panel rules, the Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue.

Jim Mattis Seeks to Soothe Tensions in Japan and South Korea

WASHINGTON —resident Trump relishes referring to his new defense secretary, Jim Mattis , as “ad Dog.”r. Mattis has never liked the nickname, which he argues is a news media invention. But to the commander in chief, it signifies a man who knows how to take the fight to the enemy and win.

During his recent alliance-mending mission in Asia, however, Mr. Mattis was more loyal friend than attack dog, hailed as a welcome voice of sober restraint.

“e appeared calm and considerate to allies despite his nickname,”aid Kookmin Ilbo , a South Korean daily newspaper. “houghtful and diligent”as the verdict of the Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper. Even the daily Tokyo Sports weighed in, describing Mr. Mattis as the “nly sensible person in the Trump administration.”

The mission, the first overseas trip by a top member of the Trump administration’ national security team, was intended to shore up relations with two essential allies, South Korea and Japan. It required a tricky balance: standing firm against North Korea’ saber rattling and China’ territorial ambitions in the South China Sea —tances that come naturally to a defense secretary —hile also reassuring allies made nervous by Mr. Trump’ campaign talk about pulling back from American security commitments in Asia.

The task was all the more challenging given the administration’ mixed signals on foreign policy and Mr. Mattis’ testimony to Congress that he was reluctant to repeat the Obama administration’ language about “ebalancing”r pivoting to Asia, because it implied that the United States was turning away from its defense obligations elsewhere.

South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North Korea, cherishes its strong alliance with the United States. But in a nation still scarred by the Korean War, many are concerned that a hawkish American administration might escalate tensions with the North. They fear that could disrupt their export-driven economy and even lead to an armed conflict with the North under its unpredictable young leader, Kim Jong-un .

During his two-day visit to Seoul, which was his first stop, Mr. Mattis pushed to deploy  an antimissile system known as Thaad, short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which would be used to intercept North Korea’ medium-range missiles. In a stark warning to Pyongyang, he said that any use of nuclear weapons  by North Korea would be met with an “verwhelming”esponse.

But Mr. Mattis also sought to remind South Koreans of the United States’ast sacrifices for their country and its commitment to their defense.

During a meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Mr. Mattis recalled how he had come to South Korea for training in the 1970s when he was a young Marine lieutenant based in Okinawa, Japan. He fondly remembered a Sergeant Chung, a South Korean marine who shared some kimchi with him. He also noted that he had commanded the First Marine Division, which had fought in 1950 in the Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War.

Such comments clearly resonated with Mr. Han and top Defense Ministry officials, all of whom are retired or serving military officers and who have had close interactions with American troops. Mr. Mattis is a retired four-star general.

“‘ad Dog’attis in South Korea was unexpectedly soft,”ead a headline in OhMyNews, a widely read online newspaper. It observed that Mr. Mattis, despite his nickname, was considered the most prudent among Trump administration officials when it came to military action because he had seen what war was like.

In Japan, Mr. Mattis sought to carry out a similar balancing act. During the campaign, Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from the mutual defense pact unless the Japanese did more to reimburse the United States more for defending their territory.

But speaking at a joint news conference with his Japanese counterpart on Saturday, Mr. Mattis said that the United States stood by the pact , reiterating that the American defense commitment extended to disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. Mr. Mattis also described Japan as “ model of cost sharing”nd praised the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for increasing spending on the military.

Strikingly, Mr. Mattis expressed caution about using military force. In contrast, Rex W. Tillerson , Mr. Trump’ new secretary of state, suggested during his confirmation hearing that the United States should be prepared to block China’ access to the islands that it has claimed in the South China Sea and built up with airfields, ports and weapons.

“e’e going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed,”r. Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month.

Mr. Mattis has long argued that diplomacy should be backed up by military might, but that force should not be the first recourse. In the case of the South China Sea, he said, it is the diplomats who should be carrying the ball.

“here is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that,”aid Mr. Mattis, who described the dispute as “omething that’ best solved by the diplomats.”

With the Trump administration in flux, and the potential for surprises from North Korea and China, it seems likely that there will be fresh challenges. But for now, Mr. Mattis appears to have succeeded in his reassurance mission in Seoul and Tokyo.

“ords matter enormously over there,”aid Michael O’anlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution . “ot only did Mattis say all the right things on issues ranging from Thaad to the Senkaku/Diaoyu to the strength of alliances to the need for a firm but steady and nondramatic U.S. approach to the South China Sea, he also went with a listening ear and little bravado. Things are definitely better, at least for the moment.”

Kerry and Albright Ask Courts to Keep Blocking Trump’ Travel Ban

A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump’ travel ban, saying the White House executive order would “ndanger U.S. troops”nd disrupt antiterrorism efforts.

The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States.

With Mr. Trump’ executive order, “e risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message”o Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. “he order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,”t said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’ national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C.I.A.

The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump’ order, saying in a statement that he “undamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.”

The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration: that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from “ery bad and dangerous people,”s Mr. Trump has put it.

Noting that the 10 signatories to the filing “ave all held the highest security clearances,”he letter asserts that Mr. Trump’ order “ltimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer.”

The travel ban was dealt a stinging setback on Friday, when a federal judge in Seattle issued the broadest ruling to date blocking major parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed Saturday, leaving the issue in the hands of the court in San Francisco.

After the appeals panel rules, the Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue.

‘4: Legacy,’ One-Hour Super Bowl Ad for Islamophobia; Critic's Notebook

Fox’ “4: Legacy”robably never intended to be taken too seriously. The post-Super Bowl pilot was an hour of television, after all, that included the franchise’ new hero, Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins), shooting down a construction pipe and using it as a deadly rolling pin.

But this reboot had seriousness thrust upon it. Running a week after Donald J. Trump’ stringent immigration restrictions on seven predominantly Muslim countries, it could have been scripted straight from the president’ direst imaginings. It was, intentionally or not, a one-hour Super Bowl ad for Islamophobia.

We open on an American home defiled —amily pictures, a Purple Heart, blood spatter on the walls. A jihadist kill team has slipped into the United States, slaughtering men, women and children, looking for a database of sleeper cells waiting to be activated.

That kind of supercompetent Islamic terror group is a staple in series like “4.”ot so much in real life, where after 9/11, Islamic terrorists in America have tended to be radicalized individuals or duos.

[See where to stream the first eight seasons of “4”t Watching, a film and TV recommendation site from The New York Times.]

But demagoguery is an act of imagination. You ask people to imagine a mushroom cloud over an American city, as Dick Cheney did in building the case for the war in Iraq. Or that Muslim refugees from the seven countries on the ban list are an existential threat, though none have carried out fatal terror attacks in the United States.

And series like “4: Legacy”ave, for years, provided that kind of raw nightmare material. The terrorists could be anywhere. They could be in your neighborhood. Or they could be in the schools, like Amira (Kathryn Prescott), the Chechen immigrant apparently planning an attack with her brother and a teacher she has under her Lolita-like spell. (Though her religion is not specifically mentioned, the subplot has overtones of the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.)

In the tradition of “4”een subplots, the story is straight-up ridiculous, but the implication is insidious, especially amid the current demonizing of immigrants and refugees: You let them in, and this is what happens. (The president has been eager to underscore this message. Sunday afternoon, in another tweet attacking the federal judge who blocked his travel ban, he darkly cited, “eople pouring in. Bad!”

Now, if you’e ever watched “4,”ou know that every one of these story lines is subject to change. There will be twists on twists, good guys may turn out bad and vice versa. (A story line in later episodes screened for critics raises the question of scapegoating.) “4: Legacy”ould surprise us; indeed, that’ pretty much its job.

But that’ a message in itself: You can never be certain. Isn’ it smarter to err on the safe side? It’ not that the show argues all Muslims are bad. It’ that it suggests any Muslim might be bad.

The best defense of “4”ight be that it’ an absurd fantasy, where America has survived multiple nuclear attacks and major cities are free of traffic snarls. No one considers it a documentary.

That’ true, but not the whole truth. People may not take “4”iterally. But many take it the way people often take entertainments —s a cartoonish version of something real.

The most obvious example is the show’ popularizing of the “icking time bomb”ustification for torture, dismissed by terrorism experts. (In the “4: Legacy”remiere, it’ the terrorists who torture and coerce information out of their captives.)

Our president, evidently, is a believer. Sean Hannity recently asked him if ABC’ David Muir —ho had questioned Mr. Trump about waterboarding —ould use the technique if a kidnapper had taken his child.

“r would you want him to talk in 48 hours from now, by being nice to him?”r. Trump responded. “nd by that time, it’ too late.”

Over the years, “4”restled with the responsibility of its characterizations. It introduced sympathetic Muslim characters and spread the villainy around: Serbians, Chinese, Russians and the evil president Logan.

Its descendant “omeland”—o-produced by Howard Gordon, an original producer of “4”nd an executive producer on the reboot —as taken pains to consult intelligence experts. They have advised, for the current season set in New York, that Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) lack the capability to pull off the kind of coordinated plot in the United States that the “4: Legacy”ilot set up. The season focuses on the case of a young Brooklyn Muslim, arrested for posting incendiary videos.

“4: Legacy”orks on a different level of realism, and it probably expected to appear in a different world. Had Hillary Clinton won the presidency, we’ be talking about the implications of casting an African-American hero, or how incongruous it looks for the show’ presidential candidate (Jimmy Smits) to be a man. The show’ stereotyping would be the same, but we would not be seeing stereotyping’ consequences playing out in real life the way they are now.

But that’ not where we are. Nor are we even in the post-9/11 heyday of “4,”hen George W. Bush stressed that Islam was a “eligion of peace.”r. Trump is under the sway of those who see all of Islam as an enemy, advisers like Stephen K. Bannon, who has said, “slam is not a religion of peace —slam is a religion of submission,”t war with the “udeo-Christian West.”

This wasn’ the only vision of America on display in the past week. Anheuser-Busch prepared a Budweiser commercial celebrating the brand’ founder, a German immigrant, for overcoming xenophobia to create an American icon. The ad went viral days before the Super Bowl.

“4: Legacy”ay not have meant to enlist in this culture war. But anyone telling this kind of story now might be supplying rhetorical ammo to people who dream of making America smaller, meaner, more homogeneous and more afraid.

Does “4”ant that to be its legacy?

Russia sought an apology from Fox News on Monday after the host Bill O’eilly described President Vladimir V. Putin as “a killer”uring an interview with President Trump.

The Kremlin’ spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that the description was “nacceptable, insulting,”ccording to the the Interfax news agency and state-run RIA Novosti agency.

“e consider such words from a Fox News correspondent to be unacceptable, insulting,”e said. “f course, we would prefer to receive apologies to our president from such a respectable television network.”

In the interview, which aired on Sunday, Mr. O’eilly asked Mr. Trump how he felt about the Russian leader.

Mr. O’eilly: “o you respect Putin?”

Mr. Trump: “ do respect him.”

Mr. O’eilly: “o you? Why?”

Mr. Trump: “ell, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn’ mean I’ going to get along with them. He’ a leader of his country. I say it’ better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS —hich is a major fight —nd Islamic terrorism all over the world —ajor fight —hat’ a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It’ very possible that I won’.”

Mr. O’eilly: “e’ a killer though. Putin’ a killer.”

Mr. Trump: “here are a lot of killers. You think our country’ so innocent?”

The president’ response, which appeared to equate Mr. Putin’ actions with those of the United States, drew outrage and dismay on social media.

An open admirer of the Russian leader, Mr. Trump has taken a conciliatory approach toward Mr. Putin, whose tenure has been known for human rights abuses, the brutal suppression of political dissent and the unnatural deaths of many political opponents.

Mr. Peskov declined to comment on Mr. Trump’ response to Mr. O’eilly.

On Monday night, Mr. O’eilly addressed the demand for an apology. Referring to the Russian president as “ld Vlad,”e said, “’ working on that apology but it may take a little time. You might want to check in with me around 2023.”

Back Story

Last week, the actor Peter Capaldi made headlines when he announced he would be leaving his starring role on “octor Who,”he long-running British television series about a time-traveling alien.

The Doctor —ho isn’ referred to as Doctor Who —s a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries.

Originally conceived as a family-friendly educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a 16-year gap (1989-2005), has been broadcast since.

The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record).

The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health.

Mr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor —nd the 12th white man —o fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his —r her —ebut.

'24' Reboot Has a Dire Ring to It

Fox's ''24: Legacy'' probably never intended to be taken too seriously. The post-Super Bowl pilot was an hour of television, after all, that included the franchise's new hero, Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins), shooting down a construction pipe and using it as a deadly rolling pin.

But this reboot had seriousness thrust upon it. Running a week after Donald J.

Does ''24'' want that to be its legacy?

Turkey Arrests Hundreds in Raids Against Islamic State

ISTANBUL -- Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday, in what constitutes one of Turkey's largest operations against the jihadist group on the country's soil.

Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Anadolu Agency, a state-run news wire. Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day. At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process, according to Anadolu.

The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer's failed coup, and on members of the country's political opposition. More than 130,000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts, according to government data.

Sunday's raids were the latest salvo in a long-running conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the early years of the Syrian revolution, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria, where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria, where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab.

Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014, most recently in the early hours of this year, when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara, Turkey's capital, that killed more than 100 people, and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul's main airport last summer.

This weekend's raids occurred across an unusually wide area, with suspects seized in 18 provinces. The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police, who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat, and an analyst who focuses on Turkey for Carnegie Europe, a think tank.

But the detentions may not necessarily lead to court cases. ''Over all, Turkey's efforts to combat the influence and network of the Islamic State at home is still handicapped by discrepancies between the different arms of the Turkish state,'' Mr. Ulgen said. ''An effort led by law enforcement is sometimes handicapped by the decisions of the Turkish judiciary, which as we have seen in the recent past has let go people associated with the Islamic State.''

Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey and a critic of the Turkish government, also questioned the effectiveness of such a large raid, which he argued could overwhelm the capacity of the counterterrorism police. Officers may not be able to properly handle the paperwork, interrogations and bureaucracy associated with processing more than 50 suspects, said Dr. Yayla, who headed counterterrorism operations in a southeast Turkish province from 2010 to 2012.

''It is impossible to process that many terrorists in one operation,'' said Dr. Yayla, who now lives in the United States, and who began to publicly criticize the Turkish government after his teenage son was jailed on suspicion of a connection to the coup attempt.

Trump's phony compassion

WASHINGTON -- In the summer of 2014, the Islamic State seized a region of northern Iraq where people of different religions and ethnic groups had coexisted since biblical times, and sought to cleanse it of everyone who was not a Sunni Muslim. ISIS killed or enslaved thousands of Yazidis and massacred Shiite Muslims. The group readily admitted that it wanted to eradicate Christianity from the Middle East. In a matter of days, more than 100,000 Iraqi Christians had fled their homes, mostly to Iraqi Kurdistan.

Last year, as an official of the Obama administration, I walked through a Christian neighborhood of the Kurdish capital, Erbil, to the beautiful St. Joseph's cathedral, where I met with leaders of every major Christian denomination in Iraq, including the patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East and the archbishop of the Chaldean Catholic Church. I also visited the Yazidi mountain shrine of Lalish, and the town of Alqosh, just a few miles north of Islamic State-controlled Mosul, where a synagogue still stands, unused for now, but protected by a local Christian family and the Muslim fighters of the Kurdish pesh merga.

Every religious leader I met asked that the United States keep the door open to refugees from their communities. But what they wanted most of all was our help in enabling their people to stay safe on their ancestral lands in Iraq. One group, the Assyrian Church of the East, felt so strongly about this that it made the brave decision to move its headquarters from Chicago back to Erbil.

I would never say that we have done enough to help persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East. How could anyone say they have done enough when so many are still suffering? But to suggest, as the Trump administration now does, that the United States has done nothing, and use this falsehood to justify favoring Christians over others among our refugee admissions, is outrageous. (On Friday, a federal judge temporarily blocked parts of the president's executive order, including this element.)

The first shots the United States fired in its fight with the Islamic State were to protect a religious minority: the Yazidis on Mount Sinjar, in northern Iraq. And we did so within days of their first call for help in 2014. From then on, we were determined to use American air power to protect civilians in the extremists' path wherever we could. When the Islamic State attacked Christian villages in the Khabur River Valley of eastern Syria in early 2015, it was our airstrikes, guided by information provided by local Christian communities, that stopped the terrorists' advance.

Since then, United States Special Operations forces have trained Christian self-defense militias that operate under Iraqi government authority. We have provided millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance to religious minority communities. And last year, Secretary of State John Kerry recognized Iraqi Yazidis, Shiites and Christians as victims of genocide. The decision took longer than some had hoped, because State Department legal experts initially told Mr. Kerry that there was not enough evidence to include Christians in this determination; he insisted on taking the time to gather the additional evidence.

Contrary to what President Trump has suggested, more than 40 percent of the refugees the United States has admitted from Iraq have been Christians or members of other religious minority groups. This was based on need, without setting any religious test. It is true that very few Christians are among the refugees we've admitted from Syria, because most Syrian refugees are Sunni Muslims who have fled the Assad regime. Syrian Christians have tended to seek protection in regime-controlled areas; of those who have left Syria, a majority have gone to Lebanon, where they have support from friends, family and a large Christian community.

Here is what Mr. Trump does not want you to know: Under his executive order, actually fewer Christian refugees will make it to the United States, even allowing for his preference for religious minorities. That is because the order slashes the quota for worldwide refugee admissions for 2017 to about 50,000 from 110,000 -- and this part of the order stays in place despite Friday's court ruling. Last year, 44 percent of admitted refugees overall happened to be Christians; at that rate, we could have expected to admit 48,000 this year.

Having now cut the global quota to 50,000, the president would have to bar almost all Muslims and other non-Christians just to keep the admissions of Christian refugees at the same level -- something that he swears he won't do, and that the courts clearly won't allow. Instead, America will reject more desperate refugees from every faith and from all over the world.

Meanwhile, the perception that Mr. Trump's order has created -- that the United States favors Christian over Muslim victims of terrorism -- will inflame tensions with Muslim-majority nations and hinder cooperation with countries like Iraq. That will actually make it harder for the United States to promote the rights of the hundreds of thousands of Christians and other minorities who want to stay in their homelands.

Of the religious leaders I met in Iraq last year, not one ever asked that we give his community preferential treatment over another. One of the Christian bishops told me that as much as his people had suffered, the Yazidis had suffered even more, and he urged us to keep helping everyone. Last week, Iraq's Catholic Chaldean patriarch denounced Mr. Trump's order as ''a trap'' that would ''feed tensions with our Muslim fellow citizens,'' adding: ''Those who seek help do not need to be divided according to religious labels. And we do not want privileges.''

The executive order will make it harder for Christians and other victims of the Islamic State to leave the Middle East, and make life more dangerous for those who stay. Anyone with an ounce of compassion or common sense will urge the president to revoke his order or Congress to repeal it.

Kerry and Albright Ask Courts to Keep Blocking Trump’ Travel Ban

A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump’ travel ban, saying the White House executive order would “ndanger U.S. troops”nd disrupt antiterrorism efforts.

The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States.

With President Trump’ executive order, “e risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message”o Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. “he order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,”t said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, the former officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’ national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C.I.A.

The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump’ order, saying in a statement that he “undamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.”

The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration: that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from “ery bad and dangerous people,”s Mr. Trump has put it.

Noting that the 10 signatories to the filing “ave all held the highest security clearances,”he letter asserts that Mr. Trump’ order “ltimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer.”

The travel ban was dealt a stinging setback on Friday, when a federal judge in Seattle issued the broadest ruling to date blocking major parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed Saturday, leaving the issue in the hands of the court in San Francisco, which indicated that it would weigh in soon after additional briefs were filed, with the last one due Monday afternoon.

After the appeals panel rules, the Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue.

‘4: Legacy,’cripted From Trump’ Dire Islamophobia

Fox’ “4: Legacy”robably never intended to be taken too seriously. The post-Super Bowl pilot was an hour of television, after all, that included the franchise’ new hero, Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins), shooting down a construction pipe and using it as a deadly rolling pin.

But this reboot had seriousness thrust upon it. Running a week after Donald J. Trump’ stringent immigration restrictions on seven predominantly Muslim countries, it could have been scripted straight from the president’ direst imaginings. It was, intentionally or not, a one-hour Super Bowl ad for Islamophobia.

We open on an American home defiled —amily pictures, a Purple Heart, blood spatter on the walls. A jihadist kill team has slipped into the United States, slaughtering men, women and children, looking for a database of sleeper cells waiting to be activated.

That kind of supercompetent Islamic terror group is a staple in series like “4.”ot so much in real life, where after 9/11, Islamic terrorists in America have tended to be radicalized individuals or duos.

But demagoguery is an act of imagination. You ask people to imagine a mushroom cloud over an American city, as Dick Cheney did in building the case for the war in Iraq. Or that Muslim refugees from the seven countries on the ban list are an existential threat, though none have carried out fatal terror attacks in the United States.

And series like “4: Legacy”ave, for years, provided that kind of raw nightmare material. The terrorists could be anywhere. They could be in your neighborhood. Or they could be in the schools, like Amira (Kathryn Prescott), the Chechen immigrant apparently planning an attack with her brother and a teacher she has under her Lolita-like spell. (Though her religion is not specifically mentioned, the subplot has overtones of the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.)

In the tradition of “4”een subplots, the story is straight-up ridiculous, but the implication is insidious, especially amid the current demonizing of immigrants and refugees: You let them in, and this is what happens. (The president has been eager to underscore this message. Sunday afternoon, in another tweet attacking the federal judge who blocked his travel ban, he darkly cited, “eople pouring in. Bad!”

Now, if you’e ever watched “4,”ou know that every one of these story lines is subject to change. There will be twists on twists, good guys may turn out bad and vice versa. (A story line in later episodes screened for critics raises the question of scapegoating.) “4: Legacy”ould surprise us; indeed, that’ pretty much its job.

But that’ a message in itself: You can never be certain. Isn’ it smarter to err on the safe side? It’ not that the show argues all Muslims are bad. It’ that it suggests any Muslim might be bad.

The best defense of “4”ight be that it’ an absurd fantasy, where America has survived multiple nuclear attacks and major cities are free of traffic snarls. No one considers it a documentary.

That’ true, but not the whole truth. People may not take “4”iterally. But many take it the way people often take entertainments —s a cartoonish version of something real.

The most obvious example is the show’ popularizing of the “icking time bomb”ustification for torture, dismissed by terrorism experts. (In the “4: Legacy”remiere, it’ the terrorists who torture and coerce information out of their captives.)

Our president, evidently, is a believer. Sean Hannity recently asked him if ABC’ David Muir —ho had questioned Mr. Trump about waterboarding —ould use the technique if a kidnapper had taken his child.

“r would you want him to talk in 48 hours from now, by being nice to him?”r. Trump responded. “nd by that time, it’ too late.”

Over the years, “4”restled with the responsibility of its characterizations. It introduced sympathetic Muslim characters and spread the villainy around: Serbians, Chinese, Russians and the evil president Logan.

Its descendant “omeland”—o-produced by Howard Gordon, an original producer of “4”nd an executive producer on the reboot —as taken pains to consult intelligence experts. They have advised, for the current season set in New York, that Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) lack the capability to pull off the kind of coordinated plot in the United States that the “4: Legacy”ilot set up. The season focuses on the case of a young Brooklyn Muslim, arrested for posting incendiary videos.

“4: Legacy”orks on a different level of realism, and it probably expected to appear in a different world. Had Hillary Clinton won the presidency, we’ be talking about the implications of casting an African-American hero, or how incongruous it looks for the show’ presidential candidate (Jimmy Smits) to be a man. The show’ stereotyping would be the same, but we would not be seeing stereotyping’ consequences playing out in real life the way they are now.

But that’ not where we are. Nor are we even in the post-9/11 heyday of “4,”hen George W. Bush stressed that Islam was a “eligion of peace.”r. Trump is under the sway of those who see all of Islam as an enemy, advisers like Stephen K. Bannon, who has said, “slam is not a religion of peace —slam is a religion of submission,”t war with the “udeo-Christian West.”

This wasn’ the only vision of America on display in the past week. Anheuser-Busch prepared a Budweiser commercial celebrating the brand’ founder, a German immigrant, for overcoming xenophobia to create an American icon. The ad went viral days before the Super Bowl.

“4: Legacy”ay not have meant to enlist in this culture war. But anyone telling this kind of story now might be supplying rhetorical ammo to people who dream of making America smaller, meaner, more homogeneous and more afraid.

Does “4”ant that to be its legacy?

Jim Mattis Seeks to Soothe Tensions in Japan and South Korea

WASHINGTON —resident Trump relishes referring to his new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as “ad Dog.”r. Mattis has never liked the nickname, which he argues is a news media invention. But to the commander in chief, it signifies a man who knows how to take the fight to the enemy and win.

During his recent alliance-mending mission in Asia, however, Mr. Mattis was more loyal friend than attack dog, hailed as a welcome voice of sober restraint.

“e appeared calm and considerate to allies despite his nickname,”aid Kookmin Ilbo, a South Korean daily newspaper. “houghtful and diligent”as the verdict of the Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper. Even the daily Tokyo Sports weighed in, describing Mr. Mattis as the “nly sensible person in the Trump administration.”

The mission, the first overseas trip by a top member of the Trump administration’ national security team, was intended to shore up relations with two essential allies, South Korea and Japan. It required a tricky balance: standing firm against North Korea’ saber rattling and China’ territorial ambitions in the South China Sea —tances that come naturally to a defense secretary —hile also reassuring allies made nervous by Mr. Trump’ campaign talk about pulling back from American security commitments in Asia.

The task was all the more challenging given the administration’ mixed signals on foreign policy and Mr. Mattis’ testimony to Congress that he was reluctant to repeat the Obama administration’ language about “ebalancing”r pivoting to Asia, because it implied that the United States was turning away from its defense obligations elsewhere.

South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North Korea, cherishes its strong alliance with the United States. But in a nation still scarred by the Korean War, many are concerned that a hawkish American administration might escalate tensions with the North. They fear that could disrupt their export-driven economy and even lead to an armed conflict with the North under its unpredictable young leader, Kim Jong-un.

During his two-day visit to Seoul, which was his first stop, Mr. Mattis pushed to deploy an antimissile system known as Thaad, short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which would be used to intercept North Korea’ medium-range missiles. In a stark warning to Pyongyang, he said that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an “verwhelming”esponse.

But Mr. Mattis also sought to remind South Koreans of the United States’ast sacrifices for their country and its commitment to their defense.

During a meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Mr. Mattis recalled how he had come to South Korea for training in the 1970s when he was a young Marine lieutenant based in Okinawa, Japan. He fondly remembered a Sergeant Chung, a South Korean marine who shared some kimchi with him. He also noted that he had commanded the First Marine Division, which had fought in 1950 in the Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War.

Such comments clearly resonated with Mr. Han and top Defense Ministry officials, all of whom are retired or serving military officers and who have had close interactions with American troops. Mr. Mattis is a retired four-star general.

“‘ad Dog’attis in South Korea was unexpectedly soft,”ead a headline in OhMyNews, a widely read online newspaper. It observed that Mr. Mattis, despite his nickname, was considered the most prudent among Trump administration officials when it came to military action because he had seen what war was like.

In Japan, Mr. Mattis sought to carry out a similar balancing act. During the campaign, Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from the mutual defense pact unless the Japanese did more to reimburse the United States more for defending their territory.

But speaking at a joint news conference with his Japanese counterpart on Saturday, Mr. Mattis said that the United States stood by the pact, reiterating that the American defense commitment extended to disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. Mr. Mattis also described Japan as “ model of cost sharing”nd praised the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for increasing spending on the military.

Strikingly, Mr. Mattis expressed caution about using military force. In contrast, Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’ new secretary of state, suggested during his confirmation hearing that the United States should be prepared to block China’ access to the islands that it has claimed in the South China Sea and built up with airfields, ports and weapons.

“e’e going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed,”r. Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month.

Mr. Mattis has long argued that diplomacy should be backed up by military might, but that force should not be the first recourse. In the case of the South China Sea, he said, it is the diplomats who should be carrying the ball.

“here is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that,”aid Mr. Mattis, who described the dispute as “omething that’ best solved by the diplomats.”

With the Trump administration in flux, and the potential for surprises from North Korea and China, it seems likely that there will be fresh challenges. But for now, Mr. Mattis appears to have succeeded in his reassurance mission in Seoul and Tokyo.

“ords matter enormously over there,”aid Michael O’anlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution. “ot only did Mattis say all the right things on issues ranging from Thaad to the Senkaku/Diaoyu to the strength of alliances to the need for a firm but steady and nondramatic U.S. approach to the South China Sea, he also went with a listening ear and little bravado. Things are definitely better, at least for the moment.”

Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea. Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.

CORRECTION APPENDEDHYDERABAD, India -- When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India's major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims.

For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State's first strike on Indian soil.

They vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement.

And from Syria, investigators believe, the group's virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots.

Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State's cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times.

As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani's offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.

In the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree.

For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured.

As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Tex., were initially labeled the work of ''lone wolves,'' with no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered.

While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group's method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.

Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State's name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

''They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process -- from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,'' said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters.

''If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.''

Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks.

Mr. Yazdani's case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group's reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.

''I fear this is the future of ISIS,'' said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs.

A Diverse Portfolio

Until roughly a year ago, Islamic State recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a ''hijrah,'' the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad's journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning.

The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits.

One of the Islamic State's most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Mr. Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate.

By 2015, Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were already actively recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia.

Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group.

But by the late spring of 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both American and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then.

Among them was Amriki himself, who was killed along with his wife on April 22, 2016, when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of the Islamic State's ''external attack planners'' who ''actively sought to harm Western interests.''

The Department of Defense's account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents.

At the same time that he was recruiting Mr. Yazdani, Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across America, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester.

Looking for ways to get to Syria, Mr. Lutchman reached out to Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. ''Dream come true,'' Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint.

Instead, the handler suggested that Mr. Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year's Eve -- less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an ''operation'' and kill ''1000000s of kuffar,'' Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Mr. Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say.

The two men discussed recruiting three other ''brothers'' to take part. They stayed in contact as Mr. Lutchman went to Walmart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar's customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say.

And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him.

Mr. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an F.B.I. informant.

At the time of his arrest, Mr. Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler's voice, or saw so much as a photograph of him, according to the court filings.

By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadists, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, Islamic State operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other Islamic State colonies, including in Libya.

That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya.

No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, the Islamic State announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home.

''If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,'' the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May.

Local Assets

At the time Amriki was killed last April, he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.

One of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad's Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.

While abroad, he began watching the Islamic State's online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.

''Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,'' Mr. Yazdani told investigators from India's National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.

He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group's preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.

''I created a Telegram ID,'' Mr. Yazdani told investigators, ''and sought his guidance to reach Syria.''

After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki's directions changed course: ''He asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.''

It was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, ''WindsofVictory.'' His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.

The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves ''Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,'' the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.

At the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men's interrogations.

''It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),'' Mr. Mohammed told investigators. ''We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.''

When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.

Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees -- around $1,000 -- and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.

Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.

The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.

As soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.

Once that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a ''bayah,'' to the Islamic State's leader.

Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to www.gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.

By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men's pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.

The men's families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.

One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.

Global Reach

Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State's stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone.

The first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been ''tééommandé'' or remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg.

When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times.

''OK, brother, now pay attention,'' one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. ''Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Méane,'' the message said. ''Look at the front right tire -- you'll find the keys placed on top.''

The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.

Later, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam's handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam's plot.

Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially ''quarterbacking'' the attack: ''They're from there, so they can essentially tell someone, 'O.K., go 10 yards and go this way.''

Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects' phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world.

In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager's handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax -- ''The damage would be much greater,'' the handler advised -- but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. ''I want to enter paradise tonight,'' he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper.

In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.

And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money.

In several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home.

Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said.

Weak Links

While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks.

Instead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the Islamic State recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself.

The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.

''He didn't even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,'' said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.

Indonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State's most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group's capital in Raqqa, Syria.

Initially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits.

In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media.

Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki's followers in Hyderabad.

The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway.

They returned to Mr. Mohammed's home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. ''We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,'' Mr. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation.

They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to ''cook the rice.''

By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed's home.

In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

Correction: March 5, 2017, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Feb. 5 about the role of the Islamic State in conceiving and guiding attacks remotely misidentified, in some editions, the embassy in Indonesia that had been targeted for a bombing in November. It was the embassy of Myanmar, not Malaysia.

Regarding Putin, Trump Suggests U.S. Isn't 'So Innocent'

President Trump, asked by an interviewer on Saturday why he respected President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even though he is ''a killer,'' seemed to equate Mr. Putin's actions with those of the United States.

''You got a lot of killers,'' he told the interviewer, Bill O'Reilly of Fox News. ''What, you think our country's so innocent?''

Mr. Trump has long expressed his admiration for the Russian leader's strength. But his willingness to seemingly draw a moral equivalence to actions by Mr. Putin, who has brutally suppressed dissent by eliminating political enemies, led to an eruption on social media.

Many asked how conservatives would have reacted had President Barack Obama, or other Democrats, compared American actions to Mr. Putin's.

The exchange surfaced on Saturday night in an excerpt from the interview, which is to be broadcast on Sunday before the Super Bowl. What Mr. Trump was specifically referring to or whether there was added context that came after his comment was not immediately clear based on the excerpt that was made available.

In the interview, Mr. Trump was asked if he respected Mr. Putin. He said he did, adding that he respected ''a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him.''

Mr. Trump continued: ''He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS -- which is a major fight -- and Islamic terrorism all over the world -- major fight -- that's a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It's very possible that I won't.''

Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to mend ties with Moscow has raised questions over his administration's commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the fighting and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

He said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, after a telephone call on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since Mr. Trump's inauguration.

''We will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,'' Mr. Trump said in a White House statement.

His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Thursday condemned Russia for its ''aggressive actions'' in eastern Ukraine.

She said the United States wanted improved relations with Russia, but added that American sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea would remain in place. She said ''the dire situation'' demanded ''clear and strong condemnation'' of Russia's actions.

In another excerpt from the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked whether it was irresponsible for him to say that three million illegal immigrants voted in the election while lacking the evidence to support that assertion.

''When you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they're on the registration rolls,'' he started to say before shifting. ''Look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this -- it's really a bad situation, it's really bad.''

DARK AT THE CROSSING

By Elliot Ackerman

237 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.

''The age of the war correspondent as hero,'' Phillip Knightley famously wrote in his book ''The First Casualty,'' ''appears to be over.'' According to Knightley, Vietnam was the high-water mark for the self-mythologizing and self-aggrandizing descendants of the war correspondent Ernie Pyle, mowed down by the Japanese on the island of Ie Shima in 1945. Since then, he argued, governments at war have learned to tame their roving journalists; to exaggerate only by a certain degree, many correspondents have become variants of the press eunuchs laconically described by Evelyn Waugh in Abyssinia sitting at the hotel bar writing up the destruction of a hospital in Adowa by Italian bombers. During that war in 1936, indeed, Waugh himself received an actual cable from his editors in London concerning the ''heroic nurses'' supposedly killed at Adowa. It read, ''Require earliest name life story photograph American nurse upblown Adowa.'' To which he immortally replied, ''Nurse unupblown.'' The journalistic stenography of war had already begun.

But what, conversely, of the war literature created by Americans not implicated in the corporate machinery of reportage? It could be argued that it's a richer harvest. And one could also argue that the most vital literary terrain in America's overseas wars is now occupied not by journalists but by novelists and even poets: Jehanne Dubrow's ''Stateside,'' Brian Turner's ''Phantom Noise,'' David Abrams's ''Fobbit,'' Nadeem Aslam's ''The Blind Man's Garden,'' the stories of Katey Schultz.

Elliot Ackerman is certainly one of those novelists, and his first novel, ''Green on Blue'' (2015), staked his claim within the terrain. Ackerman, who served in Iraq and is a recipient of the Purple Heart, now lives in Turkey. His second novel, ''Dark at the Crossing,'' has as its setting the intricate, slow-unfolding nightmare of that paradoxical country. Based in Istanbul, Ackerman is familiar with the formidably volatile and increasingly dangerous southern border zones with Syria. Much of this slender novel is set in the once pleasant city of Gaziantep -- or Antep -- whose texture he renders with economical accuracy and with gathering unease. It's a physical landscape that rarely appears in novels, and Ackerman has learned it well -- a twilight world of desolate roads, refugee tents, hordes of scavenging boys, desperados and lethal con men. Beyond it we hear the constant thud of artillery and mortars, a sound ''like soda cans crushed underfoot'' and a sinister whine of car alarms accidentally set off.

''Dark at the Crossing'' follows the attempt of an Arab-American ex-soldier named Haris Abadi, who, after having served with the United States military as an interpreter in Iraq, is now moved to enter Syria illicitly via Turkey to fight with the Islamist militias waging war against the Assad regime. It is of course a common real-life scenario. Using a digital contact bearing the code name Saladin, he makes the attempt from Antep but fails on his first try and subsequently falls in with Amir, an exiled revolutionary, and Amir's alluring wife, Daphne, who wants to return to Syria for her own reasons. These three sexually interconnected lost souls constitute the narrative's emotional skeleton. Through a web of murky connections Haris manages to arrange a possible border crossing through ISIS itself (here known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh).

In some senses, Ackerman's novel is unusual for a young writer in that it improves as it moves along rather than the reverse. The first third is heavily weighted by flashbacks relating Haris's life in Michigan with his sister -- a studio in Dearborn with a foldout couch -- and his time in Iraq dominated by his relationship with another soldier. To my mind, these chop the narrative and restrain its momentum. There are also repeated descriptions and phrases that could have been ironed out more elegantly. Things improve, however, in the last half, as Ackerman allows his tale to unfold more directly and with more uncluttered velocity. The landscape -- both ruined and splendidly ancient -- also comes more into its own:

''They left Antep, driving until the early winter sun hovered near the horizon. It cast afternoon shadows along the gentle sloping hills of Kilis Province. Where the hills spilled into farmland, herded bales of cotton spread across fields, which would remain barren until the next year. Laboring in the fields, farmers cleared and burned the harvest's stalks. Here and there flames caught wisps of cotton, and the wisps flashed like fireflies in the day. Up ahead, dangling above the smoothly laid macadam, a single traffic light was strung across the D850. It shuffled its colors to an empty road.''

They stop here at a small shanty by the road, where a teenage acquaintance named Jamil elects to join them. In a wonderful scene, the rest of the younger boys -- furious at being abandoned by their older member -- attack the car's doors with their bare palms and then, seen recedingly through the rear window, tear their own hovel to pieces in impotent rage.

The same D850 takes Haris and his group to the ramshackle border town of Kilis, where Daesh has established a clandestine base it can use to sneak into Syria: ''From the bellied domes of the grand Canpolat, Akcurun and Ulu mosques, and from the corrugated steel roofs of backdoor shanties, the faithful had built spires, clutching their way upward. Where the D850 fed into Kilis's smaller roads, the smooth highway came apart like a river feeding a delta, the single strip of black asphalt ceding to riven pathways of dirt and concrete. Ancient pedestrian lanes ran in all directions, their cobblestones too narrow for a car. Flitting in and out of traffic, and up through these tributary lanes, cheap Chinese motorcycles -- Lifans, Zongshens, Jialings -- traveled past, always carrying more than a solitary rider.''

When Haris arrives at the Daesh headquarters buried inside this warren, he notices at once the portraits of martyrs pasted along the stairwell and is struck how the expressions on their faces, ''eagerness mixed with fear,'' are indistinguishable from those on the faces of fallen American soldiers photographically exalted on the other side. He is driven to wonder what the Daesh idea of martyrdom actually is, since few outside the group appear to understand it.

''It occurred to Haris that martyrdom was an American conception. When taken in the pure Arabic, shaheed meant something different. The translation wasn't 'he who sacrifices himself,' although that was often part of it. The literal meaning was 'he who bears witness.' Standing at the desk, waiting to check into their rooms, Haris considered Amir, Daphne and even Jamil. Watching them, he no longer felt like a voyeur in their war -- he was their witness.''

Haris is interviewed by a Daesh militant named Athid, who provides a thumbnail view of the Islamist revolution in Syria and, of course, asks Haris why he would want to fight with Daesh. Seemingly convinced, despite the slight strangeness of the exchange, Athid agrees to smuggle them all into Aleppo with some laborers and accepts the money they have brought. But treachery is the rule in the Syrian badlands. When they are stopped just before dawn by a Syrian Army patrol, their reflective responses to its taunts lead to a terrible end and a realization that Daesh sometimes dresses up as its enemies to weed out false believers.

''Dark at the Crossing'' is unusual in that few of its characters are Western -- a bold move in a culture obsessed with ''appropriation.'' Whether this makes them convincing to an Arab ear is hard to say, but Ackerman's decision is clearly motivated by empathy and a desire not to tell his story through characters thinking and speaking his own language. I commend him for that; he has created people who are not the equivalents of the locally exotic subjects in your average NPR story, and he has used them to populate a fascinating and topical novel.

Lawrence Osborne's latest novel is ''Hunters in the Dark.''

Not ‘one Wolves’fter All: How  ISIS  Guides World’ Terror Plots From Afar

Correction Appended

HYDERABAD, India —hen the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India’ major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims.

For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State’ first strike on Indian soil.

They vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement.

And from Syria, investigators believe, the group’ virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots.

Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State’ cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times.

As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani’ offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.

In the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree.

For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured.

As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Tex., were initially labeled the work of “one wolves,”ith no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered.

While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group’ method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.

Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State’ name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as \b ISIS\b0 , ISIL or Daesh.

“hey are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process —rom radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,”aid Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters.

“f you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.”

Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks.

Mr. Yazdani’ case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group’ reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.

“ fear this is the future of ISIS,”aid Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs.

A Diverse Portfolio

Until roughly a year ago, Islamic State recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a “ijrah,”he Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad’ journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning.

The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits.

One of the Islamic State’ most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Mr. Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate.

By 2015, Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were already actively recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia.

Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group.

But by the late spring of 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both American and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then.

Among them was Amriki himself, who was killed along with his wife on April 22, 2016, when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa’d al-Sudani, and described him as one of the Islamic State’ “external attack planners”ho “ctively sought to harm Western interests.”

The Department of Defense’ account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents.

At the same time that he was recruiting Mr. Yazdani, Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across America, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester.

Looking for ways to get to Syria, Mr. Lutchman reached out to Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. “ream come true,”mriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint.

Instead, the handler suggested that Mr. Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year’ Eve —ess than a week after their first exchange. Plan an “peration”nd kill “000000s of kuffar,”mriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Mr. Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say.

The two men discussed recruiting three other “rothers”o take part. They stayed in contact as Mr. Lutchman went to Walmart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar’ customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say.

And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him.

Mr. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an F.B.I. informant.

At the time of his arrest, Mr. Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler’ voice, or saw so much as a photograph of him, according to the court filings.

By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadists, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, Islamic State operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other Islamic State colonies, including in Libya.

That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya.

No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, the Islamic State announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home.

“f the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,”he group’ spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May.

Local Assets

At the time Amriki was killed last April, he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.

One of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad’ Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.

While abroad, he began watching the Islamic State’ online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.

“ince then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,”r. Yazdani told investigators from India’ National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.

He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group’ preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.

“ created a Telegram ID,”r. Yazdani told investigators, “nd sought his guidance to reach Syria.”

After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki’ directions changed course: “e asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.”

It was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “indsofVictory.”is identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.

The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “und-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,”he Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.

At the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men’ interrogations.

“t was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),”r. Mohammed told investigators. “e spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.”

When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.

Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees —round $1,000 —nd leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.

Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.

The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.

As soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.

Once that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “ayah,”o the Islamic State’ leader.

Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to www.gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.

By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men’ pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.

The men’ families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.

One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.

Global Reach

Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State’ stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone.

The first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been “tééommandé,”r remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg.

When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times.

“K, brother, now pay attention,”ne of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. “earch among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Méane,”he message said. “ook at the front right tire —ou’l find the keys placed on top.”

The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.

Later, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam’ handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam’ plot.

Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially “uarterbacking”he attack: “hey’e from there, so they can essentially tell someone, ‘.K., go 10 yards and go this way.”

Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects’hones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world.

In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager’ handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax —“he damage would be much greater,”he handler advised —ut the young man said he did not have a driving permit. “ want to enter paradise tonight,”e said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper.

In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.

And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money.

In several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home.

Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said.

Weak Links

While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks.

Instead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the Islamic State recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself.

The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.

“e didn’ even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,”aid Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.

Indonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State’ most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group’ capital in Raqqa, Syria.

Initially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits.

In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media.

Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki’ followers in Hyderabad.

The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway.

They returned to Mr. Mohammed’ home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. “e could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,”r. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation.

They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to “ook the rice.”

By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed’ home.

In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

HYDERABAD, India —hen the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India’ major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims.

For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State’ first strike on Indian soil.

They vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement.

And from Syria, investigators believe, the group’ virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots.

Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State’ cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times.

As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani’ offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.

In the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree.

For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured.

As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Tex., were initially labeled the work of “one wolves,”ith no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered.

While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group’ method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.

Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State’ name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

“hey are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process —rom radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,”aid Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters.

“f you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.”

Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks.

Mr. Yazdani’ case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group’ reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.

“ fear this is the future of ISIS,”aid Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs.

Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State’ stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone.

The first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been “tééommandé,”r remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg.

When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times.

“K, brother, now pay attention,”ne of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. “earch among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Méane,”he message said. “ook at the front right tire —ou’l find the keys placed on top.”

The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.

Later, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam’ handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam’ plot.

Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially “uarterbacking”he attack: “hey’e from there, so they can essentially tell someone, ‘.K., go 10 yards and go this way.”

Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects’hones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world.

In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager’ handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax —“he damage would be much greater,”he handler advised —ut the young man said he did not have a driving permit. “ want to enter paradise tonight,”e said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper.

In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.

And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money.

In several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home.

Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said.

Weak Links

While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks.

Instead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the Islamic State recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself.

The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.

“e didn’ even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,”aid Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.

Indonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State’ most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group’ capital in Raqqa, Syria.

Initially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits.

In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media.

Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki’ followers in Hyderabad.

The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway.

They returned to Mr. Mohammed’ home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. “e could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,”r. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation.

They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to “ook the rice.”

By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed’ home.

In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

Travel Ban Strains Ties to Troops Across Iraq

BAGHDAD -- Capt. Ahmed Adnan al-Musawe had survived another day battling Islamic State fighters in Mosul last weekend when he heard startling news: The new American president had temporarily barred Iraqis from entering the United States and wanted tougher vetting.

Captain Musawe, who commands an infantry unit of the Iraqi Army's elite counterterrorism force, considers himself already fully vetted: He has been trained by American officers in Iraq and in Jordan. And backed by American advisers, he has fought the Islamic State in three Iraqi cities, including three months of brutal street combat in Mosul.

''If America doesn't want Iraqis because we are all terrorists, then America should send its sons back to Iraq to fight the terrorists themselves,'' Captain Musawe told a New York Times reporter who was with him this week at his barricaded position inside Mosul.

President Trump's Jan. 27 executive order has driven a wedge between many Iraqi soldiers and their American allies. Officers and enlisted men interviewed on the front lines in Mosul said they interpreted the order as an affront -- not only to them but also to fellow soldiers who have died in the battle for Mosul.

''An insult to their dignity,'' said Capt. Abdul Saami al-Azzi, another officer with the counterterrorism force in Mosul. He said he was hurt and disappointed by a nation he had considered a respectful partner. ''It is really embarrassing.''

The American and Iraqi militaries have negotiated an often tenuous and strained relationship over the years. But few episodes have so blindsided the current generation of Iraqi soldiers, who are accustomed to viewing the United States as their partner in a shared struggle to defeat insurgents and build a viable nation.

The timing of the order hit the Iraqi military in Mosul like an incoming rocket. Iraqi forces have reached a pivotal moment, seizing half of Mosul and preparing to assault the remaining half -- supported by American advisers, Special Operations forces and airstrikes by the United States-led coalition.

Why, some soldiers asked, had Mr. Trump chosen this moment to lump together all Iraqis as mortal threats to America -- soldiers, civilians and terrorists alike?

''This decision by Trump blows up our liberation efforts of cooperation and coordination with American forces,'' said Brig. Gen. Mizhir Khalid al-Mashhadani, a counterterrorism force commander in Mosul.

Astounded by the announcement, General Mashhadani, who speaks English, said he asked his American counterparts about the president's order. He said several told him they considered the decision hasty and its consequences poorly considered.

The travel ban was all the more perplexing to those Iraqi troops who had heard Mr. Trump vow as a candidate to wipe out the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Some also heard the president promise, when issuing the order, to keep ''radical Islamic terrorists'' out of the United States.

For some soldiers, those comments seemed to equate Iraqi soldiers -- by virtue of their nationality and religion -- with the very terrorists they were fighting.

President Trump was ''unjust and not right,'' said Maj. Sabah al-Aloosi, 37, another counterterrorism force officer in Mosul. It is Iraqi soldiers, he said, ''who are fighting terrorism on behalf of the world and sacrificing themselves.''

Col. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman in Baghdad for the American-led operation against the Islamic State, emphasized that the president's order was temporary, calling it ''a pause.''

Told of critical comments by Iraqi soldiers and officers, Colonel Dorrian said: ''For our part, we continue to do every single day what we've been doing all along in the campaign to defeat Daesh.''

Colonel Dorrian said those efforts included continuing to train and advise Iraqi security forces, and providing intelligence, artillery and airstrikes in support of Iraqi troops. ''None of these things are affected,'' he added.

One counterterrorism soldier, Ismail Khalid, said the president's ban on Iraqis did not affect his will to fight the Islamic State -- or his survival instincts. ''I've been fighting terrorism for months and what matters to me is to return home,'' he said.

The counterterrorism force soldiers spoke before the American Embassy in Baghdad on Thursday cleared the way to enter the United States for former interpreters and other Iraqis who had assisted the American government or military.

The interpreters and their families had been issued special immigrant visas because of their service to the United States. The ban on so-called S.I.V. holders was lifted after the Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt Iraqis who have tangibly demonstrated their commitment to supporting United States forces, a Pentagon spokesman said.

But Iraqis who hold valid refugee visas, some because their association with Americans exposes them to danger in Iraq, remained barred from entry to the United States.

Before the Jan. 27 ban was announced, two counterterrorism force officers in Mosul said they had begun making plans to visit the United States after the battle for Iraq's second-largest city.

Captain Musawe, who had hoped to vacation in the United States, said he was not making any travel plans at the moment. ''The decision by Trump has wasted my dreams,'' he said.

Major Aloosi said he even asked his American counterparts for advice about the visa process for Iraqi soldiers seeking to visit the ''wonderful sights and tourism'' he had seen on American TV programs. ''But all that has vaporized because of the decision by Trump,'' he said.

General Mashhadani said that despite bitter feelings among many of the soldiers he commands, he continues to work closely, if under trying circumstances, with his American counterparts.

''My American friends who are officers promised to let me in their country in case I decide to go there -- even if they have to use illegal ways,'' he said.

How ban on Syrians helps  ISIS

ISTANBUL -- Some American friends wanted me to visit in the summer to speak about a book of my essays on Syria and the Syrian revolution that is about to be published. The prospect of traveling to the United States made me uneasy. I had heard stories of Syrians being singled out for interrogation at American airports. And I wasn't certain I would be able to get travel documents and an American visa anyway: Because of my political activities, I am a man without a passport. But then, after President Trump signed an executive order barring even Syrians with valid passports and visas from the United States, I knew I wouldn't be able to visit my American friends any time soon.

Mr. Trump's decision pronouncing Syrians dangerous and undesirable seemed quite similar to the way our own dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, has treated me and my countrymen. I have never had a passport. I was explicitly denied one by Mr. Assad's regime because I am a writer who opposed his father and opposes him. In 1980, I was a 19-year-old student of medicine at the University of Aleppo when I joined the protests against the Hafez al-Assad regime. I was jailed along with hundreds of fellow left-wing students and activists. I spent 16 years in prison.

After my release in 1996, I returned to Aleppo and my medical studies. After graduating in 2000, I decided not to practice medicine, moved to Damascus and worked as a writer. In March 2011, Syrians rose up against the Bashar al-Assad regime. I decided to write without any self-censorship in support of the revolution. The cost of writing with freedom was that I had to leave my home in Damascus, hide in myriad places across the country, and eventually seek refuge in Turkey. To live in exile without a passport or travel documents is to live with the knowledge of limited mobility in a world of militarized bureaucracy.

The international disdain for Syrian refugees comes close to Mr. Assad's approach to his ill-fated subjects. Most Syrians were never issued passports. For the Assad regime, passports are political and disciplinary tools.

For Syrians, Mr. Trump is merely pushing to extremes a process that has been going on for years. The situation of the refugees, and the underprivileged in general, has been worsening everywhere for a generation. Syria exemplifies a greater global failure.

The executive order barring Syrians and the citizens of six other countries was among Mr. Trump's very first actions in the White House. Many of the objectives of the first week of his reign -- setting the stage to build a wall on the Mexico border, and cutting federal funds to environmental research and programs involving abortion -- are aimed at the vulnerable and the poor. It reveals a lot about the social and political outlook of his administration.

Mr. Trump's reactionary decree banning Syrian refugees and visitors from other Muslim-majority countries has dangerous side effects: It normalizes war criminals like Mr. Assad, dictators like Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, and helps the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the war on terrorism and the threat of Islamist militants became central to the way the United States saw and dealt with the world. Despotic regimes exploit this American fear of Islamist militancy and get away with brutal violence against dissenting populations of varying political and religious persuasions by projecting them as jihadists.

Terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State use discriminatory acts such as Mr. Trump's ban to depict the West as fundamentally anti-Muslim and position themselves as defenders of the Islamic realm. They thrive in a world of hatred, fear and retreat.

Among many Muslims, Mr. Trump's executive order is rightly perceived as Islamophobic and as encouraging sectarian divisions in both Syria and the region. But these are hardly new traits of American and Western policies in the Middle East.

As a Syrian, I can recall a shameful precedent for Mr. Trump's indifference toward the suffering of refugees. On Aug. 21, 2013, in its biggest chemical weapons attack, the Assad regime used sarin gas against the besieged East Ghouta area outside Damascus and killed more than 1,400 people, including 426 children. In mid-September 2013, the United States and Russia made a deal concerning Syria's chemical weapons. Under the deal Mr. Assad acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and submitted his chemical weapons (except chlorine, which doesn't fall under it), and in exchange he was exempted from punishment from their use and was practically guaranteed his survival.

Mr. Assad concluded rightly that he could continue killing rebels with any weapons except the chemical weapons. President Barack Obama chose not to enforce a no-fly zone, so Mr. Assad continued dropping barrel bombs on homes, schools and hospitals in rebel-held areas. Mr. Obama essentially did nothing to match the deal with any protections for the rebelling Syrians.

The chemical weapons deal was an enormous gift to extremist groups like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State, lending credibility to their nihilist discourse that the world is against us and those who seek justice for Muslims in the Western world order are misguided, even agents of crusaders.

The flight of millions of Syrians to neighboring countries and Europe only intensified after the chemical weapons agreement, which dealt a brutal blow to our hopes for political change. In 2014, the Assad regime started aggressive military offensives on multiple cities. Ethnic cleansing forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Barrel bomb attacks on residential areas were intensified. Thus the Syrian refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015 was born of the chemical weapons agreement in 2013.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may be very different personalities, but so far, Mr. Trump's administration seems like just a continuation of Mr. Obama's in terms of its attitude toward Syria and the Middle East.

For about half a century, the people of the Middle East have been denied political freedoms, economic security and oppressed by violent juntas like the Assad regime. If a class of Americans felt let down by their political establishment, felt their economic security slipping away and elected Mr. Trump, why is it surprising that the Middle East has given rise to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda?

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , more than four million Syrians are refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Around 6.3 million are internally displaced within Syria. Of these approximately 11 million Syrians who have lost their homes, the United States has accepted around 10,000.

His ban will strengthen the Islamic State and Al Qaeda as it creates a world in which people are left with little hope, and Muslims, in particular, are discriminated against.

Mr. Trump is considering ''safe zones'' in Syria for Syrian refugees. But given his worldview and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, an Assad ally, nothing encourages us to think of it as an effort to protect an exposed and dehumanized people from the Assad regime or from the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. I am afraid Mr. Trump's ''safe zones'' will simply confine and isolate us. Mr. Trump should realize that we already have such an arrangement in place to quarantine Syrians: Mr. Assad's Syria.

Assailant Near Louvre Is Shot by French Soldier

PARIS — man armed with two large knives and shouting “od is great”n Arabic lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre on Friday, causing little harm, but rattling a city already on edge over terrorist attacks and casting another shadow over its international image.

A soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries.

The Paris prosecutor, Françis Molins, said the attacker, who was 29 years old, was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on a visa he obtained last November.

The intervention by soldiers from the 1er Réiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes, an airborne unit based in Pamiers, in southwestern France, “nded a terrorist attack and enabled the arrest of its perpetrator, who by all indications was very determined,”r. Molins said.

The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum’ entrances.

The attack was so close to the Louvre that it lit up social media networks. Within a couple hours of the assault, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the man was a “adical Islamic terrorist,”lthough the French authorities said it was too early to establish whether he had ties to any terrorist groups.

Mr. Molins, who is known for sticking to the facts, refrained from saying anything about the man’ motivations, but said that his passport had two visas to Turkey, in 2015 and 2016, and that he also had a visa for Saudi Arabia. He had a residency document for the United Arab Emirates.

Mr. Molins did not say where the man might have traveled in Turkey. Until recently, a stretch of the eastern Turkish border with Syria was highly porous, and many people slipped into territory held by the Islamic State in Syria’ northeast.

The man was not known to the French security authorities, but he was identified through fingerprints and a photograph taken when he obtained his visa, Mr. Molins said.

The suspect had rented an apartment for one week, paying about $1,830, in a well-heeled neighborhood just four subway stops from the Louvre. Two days after arriving in Paris, he bought two military-grade 16-inch knives at an arms store in central Paris for about $730, according to the authorities.

France has suffered more terrorist attacks and attempted attacks in recent years than any other country in Europe, and security officials believe that the country and especially its police and military forces, remain a target of choice for Islamic extremists.

Some of those attacks involve knives and were carried out by people who say they were inspired by the example of the Islamic State even if they had never traveled to Syria or Iraq or sworn allegiance to the organization. Mr. Molins noted that Friday’ attack occurred exactly two years after a similar attack on soldiers in Nice.

In just the past 13 months, there have been at least four attacks in France using knives, including one instance in which an off-duty police officer and wife were stabbed to death by a man who then filmed himself claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, broadcasting the video on Facebook.

In St.-Éienne-du-Rouvray, a small town in Normandy, a 19-year-old man slit the throat of an elderly priest as he was saying Mass last July. The young man and an accomplice, who were fatally shot by the police, had proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State just before the murder.

Then there were the shocking assaults that claimed many more lives. On July 14, a man driving a truck plowed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice, killing 86 people. And on Nov. 13, 2015, three attacks carried out by 10 Islamic State terrorists in and around Paris took the lives of 130 people.

Although the Louvre attack was swiftly contained and involved only one assailant, it was likely to add to the woes of the museum and the city, where the number of visitors declined significantly in 2016 because of successive terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. The number of visitors to the Louvre was down 15 percent from 2015, and the number of foreign visitors fell, notably from Russia, Japan, China and Brazil.

Friday’ attack also coincided with the city’ final presentation of its bid for the 2024 Olympic Games, casting something of a pall over a day that Paris officials had hoped would not be associated with terrorism.

Still, the quick response by the military was likely to ease criticism about the expense and efficacy of using soldiers alongside the police to fight terrorism.

When terrorists carried out a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 attacks, soldiers were nearby but were not under orders to act and were unable to aid the police, raising questions about their usefulness. While the situation on Friday was different —he soldiers were acting in self-defense —t was described repeatedly by politicians and senior government officials as a display of preparedness and “ang-froid.”

About 10,000 soldiers are deployed throughout France, with 3,500 in the Paris region alone.

Many people were also impressed by the calm efficiency displayed by the staffs of both the museum and the Carrousel du Louvre.

The museum had several rooms designated as secure places, and guards escorted visitors to those areas.

Bastien Lopez, 21, an intern at the museum, said he was at work when “ll of a sudden we saw a huge flow of people coming in the museum, and the people in charge of the security shut down the three main access doors.”

“hen they asked us to follow an itinerary that led us into a specific room,”e said, “here we stayed confined for two hours and a half.”e stayed in one of the rooms of the department of Islamic art, in the museum’ basement, with a few hundred people.

“t wasn’ a rush: Everything went very smoothly,”r. Lopez added. “e were not piled up; we could all sit on the floor. Some people took a nap.”

“he tourists reacted super well. The security persons were given instructions that we translated in English and in Chinese.”

Thomas, a 21-year-old who declined to give his surname, said he was doing maintenance work on electronic screens in the underground mall when he heard gunfire nearby.

He suspected an attack, yet his first reaction was not fear, but a “urvival instinct,”ueled by a “urge of adrenaline,”e recalled as he stood near a police cordon a few hours later.

“ followed the protocol, which was to leave through the emergency exits, since we were in one of the stores,”e said. “ evacuated, and I took two people with me.”

Travel Ban Drives Wedge Between Iraqi Soldiers and Americans

BAGHDAD —apt. Ahmed Adnan al-Musawe had survived another day battling Islamic State fighters in Mosul last weekend when he heard startling news: The new American president had temporarily banned Iraqis from entering the United States and wanted tougher vetting.

Captain Musawe, who commands an infantry unit of the Iraqi Army’ elite counterterrorism force, considers himself already fully vetted: He has been trained by American officers in Iraq and in Jordan. And backed by American advisers, he has fought the Islamic State in three Iraqi cities, including three months of brutal street combat in Mosul.

“f America doesn’ want Iraqis because we are all terrorists, then America should send its sons back to Iraq to fight the terrorists themselves,”aptain Musawe said this week at his barricaded position inside Mosul.

President Trump’ Jan. 27 executive order has driven a wedge between many Iraqi soldiers and their American allies. Officers and enlisted men interviewed on the front lines in Mosul said they interpreted the order as an affront —ot only to them but to fellow soldiers who have died in the battle for Mosul.

“n insult to their dignity,”aid Capt. Abdul Saami al-Azzi of the counterterrorism force, who said he was hurt and disappointed by a nation he had considered a respectful partner. “t is really embarrassing.”

The American and Iraqi militaries have negotiated an often tenuous and strained relationship over the years. But few episodes have so blindsided the current generation of Iraqi soldiers, who are accustomed to viewing the United States as their partner in a shared struggle to defeat insurgents and build a viable nation.

The timing of the order hit the Iraqi military in Mosul like an incoming rocket. Iraqi forces have reached a pivotal moment, seizing half of Mosul and preparing soon to assault the remaining half —upported by American advisers, Special Operations forces and airstrikes by the United States-led coalition.

Why, some soldiers asked, had Mr. Trump chosen this moment to lump together all Iraqis as mortal threats to America —oldiers, civilians and terrorists alike?

“his decision by Trump blows up our liberation efforts of cooperation and coordination with American forces,”aid Brig. Gen. Mizhir Khalid al-Mashhadani, a counterterrorism force commander in Mosul.

Astounded by the announcement, General Mashhadani, who speaks English, said he asked his American counterparts about the president’ order. He said several told him they considered the decision hasty and its consequences poorly considered.

The travel ban was all the more perplexing to those Iraqi troops who had heard Mr. Trump vow as a candidate to wipe out the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Some also heard the president promise, when issuing the order, to keep “adical Islamic terrorists”ut of the United States.

For some soldiers, those comments seemed to equate Iraqi soldiers —y virtue of their nationality and religion —ith the very terrorists they were fighting.

President Trump was “njust and not right,”aid Maj. Sabah al-Aloosi, 37, another counterterrorism force officer in Mosul. It is Iraqi soldiers, he said, “ho are fighting terrorism on behalf of the world and sacrificing themselves.”

Col. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman in Baghdad for the American-led operation against the Islamic State, emphasized that the president’ order was temporary, calling it “ pause.”

Told of critical comments by Iraqi soldiers and officers, Colonel Dorrian said: “or our part, we continue to do every single day what we’e been doing all along in the campaign to defeat Daesh.”

Colonel Dorrian said those efforts included continuing to train and advise Iraqi security forces, and providing intelligence, artillery and airstrikes in support of Iraqi troops. “one of these things are affected,”e added.

One counterterrorism soldier, Ismail Khalid, said the president’ ban on Iraqis did not affect his will to fight the Islamic State –r his survival instincts. “’e been fighting terrorism for months and what matters to me is to return home,”e said.

The counterterrorism force soldiers spoke before the American Embassy in Baghdad on Thursday cleared the way to enter the United States for former interpreters and other Iraqis who had assisted American troops.

The interpreters and their families had been issued special immigrant visas because of their service to the United States. The ban on so-called S.I.V. holders was lifted after the Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt Iraqis who have tangibly demonstrated their commitment to supporting United States forces, a Pentagon spokesman said.

But Iraqis who hold valid refugee visas, some because their association with Americans exposes them to danger in Iraq, remained barred from entry to the United States.

Before the Jan. 27 ban was announced, two counterterrorism force officers in Mosul said, they had begun making plans to visit the United States after the battle for Iraq’ second-largest city.

Captain Musawe, who had hoped to vacation in the United States, said he was not making any travel plans at the moment. “he decision by Trump has wasted my dreams,”e said.

Major Aloosi said he even asked his American counterparts for advice about the visa process for Iraqi soldiers seeking to visit the “onderful sights and tourism”e had seen on American TV programs. “ut all that has vaporized because of the decision by Trump,”e said.

General Mashhadani said that despite bitter feelings among many of the soldiers he commands, he continues to work closely, if under trying circumstances, with his American counterparts.

“y American friends who are officers promised to let me in their country in case I decide to go there —ven if they have to use illegal ways,”e said.

Wary of Rhetoric, Groups Turn Down U.S. Aid to Fight Extremism

WASHINGTON -- Community groups in Michigan and Minnesota have decided to reject hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal aid to fight violent extremism because of what they call the Trump administration's vilification of Muslims.

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups.

The group in Minnesota decided to reject the money after Trump administration officials were reported to be considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. The effort, now known as Countering Violent Extremism, or C.V.E., would be renamed Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, Reuters reported on Thursday.

That group, Ka Joog, which works with Somali youths in Minneapolis, said in a statement that its board had decided not to take the nearly $500,000 it was awarded last month because it believed that its efforts had ''been hindered by the Trump administration to instill fear, uncertainty and anti-Muslim sentiments.''

The Michigan group, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, in Dearborn, said it would also reject $500,000 in federal aid. Suehaila Amen, an executive board member, said that her group had already been discussing before the Reuters report came out whether to accept the grant, because some in the community see the hotly disputed program as a way to spy on Muslims. But the decision was sealed by Mr. Trump's statements and actions, Ms. Amen said.

''You're talking about a president who has maligned the Muslims throughout the entire campaign,'' she said. ''We don't feel like we need to compromise our integrity, transparency and integrity in the community for some money or funding.''

Another organization, the Muslim Public Affairs Council Foundation, which has offices in Washington and Los Angeles, said it was waiting to see whether the administration moved forward with changes to the program before deciding whether to keep its nearly $400,000 grant.

And Jihad Turk, the president of Bayan Claremont, a graduate college in Claremont, Calif., for Muslim scholars and religious leaders, said it would not accept its $800,000 grant, one of the largest awarded, if the administration renamed the program and entirely shifted its focus.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment, though people briefed on the matter said there was fierce resistance inside the department to making changes to the program that could further alienate Muslim communities assisting antiterrorism efforts. During his confirmation hearing as department secretary last month, John F. Kelly stressed the need to build trust with Muslim communities.

But the administration's possible move aligns with Mr. Trump's campaign promises to defeat what he called ''radical Islamic terrorism,'' as well as with the views of some of his advisers. Stephen K. Bannon, the president's top strategist, has said that Islam is not a religion of peace, while Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, once said that fear of Muslims was rational.

Counterterrorism experts say that the administration risks eroding years of bridge building between the government and Muslim communities, which have long been suspicious of the counterextremism programs.

''Going forward, Muslim communities may fear that information provided for C.V.E. programs and target audiences will be used instead for surveillance, prosecution and/or deportation,'' said J. M. Berger, a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague and co-author of ''ISIS: The State of Terror.'' ''Those fears may now be justified.''

Erroll G. Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States.

Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. From 2009 to 2016, according to figures from the Anti-Defamation League, these groups accounted for 84 percent of the extremist violence in which shots were exchanged with law enforcement.

''Data should dictate policy,'' Mr. Southers said. ''If you ignore data, you ignore the real problem, which is that extremism comes from a diverse range of sources.''

The federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations saying they stigmatize entire communities.

In Minneapolis, some groups have participated in a program run by the local United States attorney to counter Islamic State propaganda efforts directed at Somalis. But other groups have criticized the government's efforts, saying they are overwhelmingly focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities and pay little attention to the threats posed by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists.

Faiza Patel, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent Extremism Program would make a bad project worse.

''It makes explicit what was already implied in C.V.E.,'' she said. ''Now all of that window dressing goes out the door.''

Despite millions of dollars in government-sponsored research, there remains no consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist or how to identify such people before they attack.

Clark R. McCauley Jr., a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years, said that programs to counter extremism were already too focused on Islamic terrorism. ''It's not all that easy to get money to study right-wing stuff,'' he said. ''There's a big oversupply of attention to Islamic extremism as it is.''

Making that focus more explicit may not significantly change how the programs operate, he said. ''But what it will mean for Muslims in the U.S., that's going to be a problem, even if the machinery doesn't change,'' Professor McCauley said. ''It means the country has decided to say, 'You people are a special threat.'''

Christian Picciolini, the founder of Life After Hate, a Chicago group devoted to countering right-wing extremism, said it would be dangerous to minimize white extremism, pointing to gunmen like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and Wade Michael Page, who killed six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.

''They are being radicalized by fake news and conspiracy theories,'' he said of such attackers. ''We are ignoring a massive domestic terrorism problem that already exists in our borders.''

How  ISIS  Benefits From Trump’ Ban on Syrians

ISTANBUL —ome American friends wanted me to visit in the summer to speak about a book of my essays on Syria and the Syrian revolution that is about to be published. The prospect of traveling to the United States made me uneasy. I had heard stories of Syrians being singled out for interrogation  at American airports. And I wasn’ certain I would be able to get travel documents and an American visa anyway: Because of my political activities, I am a man without a passport. But then, after President Trump signed an executive order barring even Syrians with valid passports and visas from the United States, I knew I wouldn’ be able to visit my American friends any time soon.

Mr. Trump’ decision pronouncing Syrians dangerous and undesirable seemed quite similar to the way our own dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, has treated me and my countrymen. I have never had a passport. I was explicitly denied one by Mr. Assad’ regime because I am a writer who opposed his father and opposes him. In 1980, I was a 19-year-old student of medicine at the University of Aleppo when I joined the protests against the Hafez  al-Assad regime. I was jailed along with hundreds of fellow left-wing students and activists. I spent 16 years in prison.

After my release in 1996, I returned to Aleppo and my medical studies. After graduating in 2000, I decided not to practice medicine, moved to Damascus and worked as a writer. In March 2011, Syrians rose up against the Bashar al-Assad regime. I decided to write without any self-censorship in support of the revolution. The cost of writing with freedom was that I had to leave my home in Damascus, hide in myriad places across the country, and eventually seek refuge in Turkey. To live in exile without a passport or travel documents is to live with the knowledge of limited mobility in a world of militarized bureaucracy.

The international disdain for Syrian refugees comes close to Mr. Assad’ approach to his ill-fated subjects. Most Syrians were never issued passports. For the Assad regime, passports are political and disciplinary  tools.

For Syrians, Mr. Trump is merely pushing to extremes a process that has been going on for years. The situation of the refugees, and the underprivileged in general, has been worsening everywhere for a generation. Syria exemplifies a greater global failure.

The executive order barring Syrians and the citizens of six other countries was among Mr. Trump’ very first actions in the White House. Many of the objectives of the first week of his reign —etting the stage to build a wall on the Mexico border, and cutting federal funds to environmental research and programs involving abortion —re aimed at the vulnerable and the poor. It reveals a lot about the social and political outlook of his administration.

Mr. Trump’ reactionary decree banning Syrian refugees and visitors from other Muslim-majority countries has dangerous side effects: It normalizes war criminals like Mr. Assad, dictators like Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, and helps the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the war on terrorism and the threat of Islamist militants became central to the way the United States saw and dealt with the world. Despotic regimes exploit this American fear of Islamist militancy and get away with brutal violence against dissenting populations of varying political and religious persuasions by projecting them as jihadists.

Terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State use discriminatory acts such as Mr. Trump’ ban to depict the West as fundamentally anti-Muslim and position themselves as defenders of the Islamic realm. They thrive in a world of hatred, fear and retreat.

Among many Muslims, Mr. Trump’ executive order is rightly perceived as Islamophobic and as encouraging sectarian divisions in both Syria and the region. But these are hardly new traits of American and Western policies in the Middle East.

As a Syrian, I can recall a shameful precedent for Mr. Trump’ indifference toward the suffering of refugees. On Aug. 21, 2013, in its biggest chemical weapons attack, the Assad regime used sarin gas against the besieged East Ghouta area outside Damascus and killed more than 1,400 people, including 426  children. In mid-September 2013, the United States and Russia made a deal concerning Syria’ chemical weapons. Under the deal Mr. Assad acceded  to the Chemical Weapons Convention and submitted his chemical weapons (except chlorine, which doesn’ fall under it), and in exchange he was exempted from punishment from their use and was practically guaranteed his survival.

Mr. Assad concluded rightly that he could continue killing rebels with any weapons except the chemical weapons. President Barack Obama chose not to enforce a no-fly zone, so Mr. Assad continued dropping barrel bombs on homes, schools and hospitals in rebel-held areas. Mr. Obama essentially did nothing to match the deal with any protections for the rebelling Syrians.

The chemical weapons deal was an enormous gift to extremist groups like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State, lending credibility to their nihilist discourse that the world is against us and those who seek justice for Muslims in the Western world order are misguided, even agents of crusaders.

The flight of millions of Syrians to neighboring countries and Europe only intensified after the chemical weapons agreement, which dealt a brutal blow to our hopes for political change. In 2014, the Assad regime started aggressive military offensives on multiple cities. Ethnic cleansing forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Barrel bomb attacks on residential areas were intensified. Thus the Syrian refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015 was born of the chemical weapons agreement in 2013.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may be very different personalities, but so far, Mr. Trump’ administration seems like just a continuation of Mr. Obama’ in terms of its attitude toward Syria and the Middle East.

For about half a century, the people of the Middle East have been denied political freedoms, economic security and oppressed by violent juntas like the Assad regime. If a class of Americans felt let down by their political establishment, felt their economic security slipping away and elected Mr. Trump, why is it surprising that the Middle East has given rise to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda?

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , more than four million  Syrians are refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Around 6.3 million are internally displaced within Syria. Of these approximately 11 million Syrians who have lost their homes, the United States has accepted around 10,000.

His ban will strengthen the Islamic State and Al Qaeda as it creates a world in which people are left with little hope, and Muslims, in particular, are discriminated against.

Mr. Trump is considering “afe zones”n Syria for Syrian refugees. But given his worldview and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, an Assad ally, nothing encourages us to think of it as an effort to protect an exposed and dehumanized people from the Assad regime or from the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. I am afraid Mr. Trump’ “afe zones”ill simply confine and isolate us. Mr. Trump should realize that we already have such an arrangement in place to quarantine Syrians: Mr. Assad’ Syria.

An Apology to Muslims for President Trump; Op-Ed Columnist

Whenever an extremist in the Muslim world does something crazy, people demand that moderate Muslims step forward to condemn the extremism. So let’ take our own advice: We Americans should now condemn our own extremist.

In that spirit, I hereby apologize to Muslims. The mindlessness and heartlessness of the travel ban should humiliate us, not you. Understand this: President Trump is not America!

I apologize to Nadia Murad, the brave young Yazidi woman from Iraq who was made a sex slave —ut since escaping, has campaigned around the world against ISIS and sexual slavery. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, yet is now barred from the United States.

I apologize to Edna Adan, a heroic Somali woman who has battled for decades for women’ health and led the fight against female genital mutilation. Edna speaks at American universities, champions girls’ducation and defies extremists —nd she’ one of those inspiring me to do the same.

I don’ want to take Trump-as-an-extremist too far: He’ not beheading anyone, and the security challenge is real. Nobody has a problem with improving safety, and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both oversaw improvements in vetting. Yet Trump tackled the issue in a way that bolsters the ISIS narrative and thus makes us less safe.

In effect, Trump took a real problem, inflated it with hysteria, handled it with incompetence and created an unjust policy that targets seven mostly impoverished Muslim countries that haven’ produced a single person involved in a lethal terrorist attack in America since before 9/11. Islamophobia swirls through the order, and Rudy Giuliani has helpfully explained that Trump asked him to devise a way to create a Muslim ban and “o it legally.”

There’ a certain symmetry here.

I’e sat down in mosques in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and heard jihadists justify intolerance. Those men (always men!) “therize”nfidels as fundamentally different, as threats who must be confronted; Trump “therizes”uslims in a similar way.

Trump’ national security adviser, Mike Flynn, has referred to Islam as a “ancer”nd has shared a video asserting that Islam “ants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.”hat’ the mirror image of the bigotry I hear from jihadists who tell me that Jews were behind the 9/11 attacks.

The real chasm is not between Muslims and others, but between the moderates and the extremists of whatever religion.

A Reuters poll found that many Americans approve of Trump’ travel ban, but that’ not surprising. The same was true of barring Jewish refugees in the 1930s, and of interning Japanese-Americans in 1942. When we’e fearful, we’e vulnerable to politicians who play on our fears and scapegoat immigrants; in the fullness of time, we come to regret our xenophobic behavior and to appreciate the immigrants.

So I apologize to Muslims. I have seen the worst of Islam, but also the best.

The newly chosen Rhodes scholars include a Somali refugee, Ahmed Ahmed, who was born in a Kenya refugee camp and was admitted to the U.S. as a 1-year-old. Raised by a struggling single mom, sometimes showing up at high school at 5:30 a.m. to study, he attended Cornell and won the university’ outstanding student award. Such people don’ threaten us, but enrich us.

If we need an inspiring example of how moderates can successfully challenge extremists, consider an extraordinary Somali gynecologist, Dr. Hawa Abdi, who ran a displaced persons camp in Somalia, including a 400-bed hospital (and a jail for men who beat their wives). Islamic militants, enraged that a woman was running such an important enterprise, ordered her to hand it over. When she refused, 750 armed militants from the Party of Islam attacked the camp and ordered Dr. Abdi to run it under their direction. She refused.

Yet Dr. Abdi’ camp, serving 90,000 people, was just about the only thing working properly in Somalia, and Somalis at home and around the world united to denounce the militants and speak up for her. The pressure on the gunmen grew. Finally, they slunk off.

If Somalis can stand up to extremists, we can, too.

Indeed, that is happening. When Japanese-Americans were rounded up, other Americans were silent. Today, it is heartwarming to see Americans of all creeds standing up against similar bigotry. In Victoria, Tex., after a mysterious fire destroyed the only mosque just hours after Trump announced his travel ban, local Jewish leaders gave Muslims a key to their synagogue. Four churches also offered their space for as long as needed, and in just a few days, people of all faiths contributed $1 million to build a new mosque.

At an airport protest, one much-shared photo showed a Jewish man and a Muslim man protesting side by side, each with a child on his shoulders.

My dream is of the day when Jews protest Islamophobia, Muslims denounce the persecution of Christians and Christians stand against anti-Semitism. That’ why I apologize to Muslims, and it’ why ALL of us, not just Muslims, should stand up to condemn extremism in our midst.

Visa Ban Amended to Allow Iraqi Interpreters Into U.S.

BAGHDAD —he Trump administration amended its visa ban on Thursday to allow emigration by the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the United States government and military forces deployed in their country.

The change, recommended by the Pentagon, eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump’ executive order imposing the ban, which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week.

The order temporarily blocked all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspended visas for applicants from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq. It applied to holders of so-called Special Immigrant Visas issued to interpreters who worked for the United States during its 2003-11 occupation, often at great personal risk, and to their families.

In a statement about the change sent to The New York Times, a United States Embassy official in Baghdad said, “he U.S. government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (S.I.V.) holders to continue to travel to the United States.”raqis who have received the visas, the statement said, may use them, and the “.S. Embassy in Baghdad will continue to process and issue S.I.V.s to applicants who are otherwise qualified.”

For the family of a 37-year-old Iraqi who once worked as an interpreter for American forces, the news was a joyous surprise after nearly a week of upended travel plans. An embassy official called to inform family members that they were again permitted to fly to the United States.

“’ shocked all over again,”aid the former interpreter, who asked to be identified only by his first name and an initial, Munther A., to protect relatives in Iraq.

The travel ban has thrown the lives of many former interpreters in Iraq into turmoil. Even with valid visas in hand, some were refused entry at American airports and others were removed from planes scheduled to fly to the United States.

There was also confusion because the executive order, at least initially, barred entry to Iraqis who held American green cards. Many of them, but not all, were eventually permitted to enter the United States.

The Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt from the travel ban Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who had demonstrated their commitment to American military forces.

Munther A. and his family were removed from a Turkish Airlines flight in Istanbul on Saturday just as they had settled into their seats for a scheduled flight to Kennedy Airport. They were forced to fly back to Baghdad, he said.

Most Iraqis holding the special visas have sold their homes, cars and other possessions in anticipation of starting a new life in the United States. Munther A. said his family had been forced to find emergency housing with friends in Baghdad.

Since 2007, the State Department has issued more than 1,700 Special Immigrant Visas to Iraqi interpreters and their family members.

The embassy in Baghdad did not disclose the number of Iraqis affected by the change in the Trump administration’ visa ban. Only 19 such visas were issued to Iraqi interpreters and their families during the past three years, according to State Department figures.

Mr. Trump said when he issued the executive order that it was intended to allow American officials to vet Iraqis and others more thoroughly. But the interpreters had extensive security vetting before they were permitted to accompany American forces. They spent years clearing more background security checks while applying for the special visas.

Even after the phone call from the embassy, Munther A. and his family were initially turned away by airline officials in Baghdad on Thursday as they tried to board a connecting flight to Doha, Qatar. He called a telephone number provided by the embassy, he said, and the problem was resolved.

“e’e getting on the flight now,”unther A. said in a telephone interview from the Baghdad airport late Thursday afternoon.

He said his 7-year-old daughter was in tears on Saturday because the canceled flight meant she would not be able to visit Disneyland, as her father had promised. “ told her she’ going now,”unther A. said.

Thousands of interpreters, known to the troops as “erps,”ode for years with American forces on combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were given American nicknames like Tony and Bobby and Max. They often wore scarves across their faces to mask their identities.

They risked their lives as the eyes and ears of the American military in Iraq. They did far more than just interpret, guiding American soldiers and commanders through Iraqi politics, tribal disputes and social customs.

Other Iraqis who assisted the American military or government in Iraq indirectly remained in limbo on Thursday. Many had received refugee visas to resettle in the United States with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, but they were blocked by the travel ban this week.

A 33-year-old Iraqi father of two who worked seven years for a contractor that supplied American troops said he and his family had been granted visas for relocation to Charlotte, N.C., after passing extensive security checks. They were scheduled to fly from Iraq to the United States on Thursday, said the man, who asked to be identified as Ahmed A.

He was told by the International Organization for Migration this week that his flight had been canceled because of the travel ban. Having already sold his home and car and quit his job, he scrambled to find a place to live with friends in Erbil, Iraq.

Ahmed A. said he had heard nothing from the International Organization for Migration as of Thursday. A spokesman for the organization in Iraq did not respond to a request for comment.

There also was confusion on Thursday for Qusay Fawzi Ahmed, 38, a former military interpreter who moved to Tampa, Fla., in 2012, after receiving a special immigrant visa.

On Saturday, Mr. Ahmed was awaiting a phone call from his fiancé, Marwa Nasr al-Din, who was flying to New York from Iraq with a valid visa in her passport. After years of waiting, she said, she received approval to join her fiancé

Mr. Ahmed, who works at Domino’, said he was delivering a pizza in Tampa when his fiancé called him from Kennedy Airport. She told him she had been detained and ordered to fly back to Cairo, where her flight had originated, and then to her home in Erbil.

“y fiancé is a 25-year-old girl —he’ not going to bomb anything,”r. Ahmed said in a telephone interview.

Ms. Din said on Thursday that she had been unable to find out when, or whether, her visa would allow her to join her fiancén Tampa.

“s this the freedom and democracy we have heard about in the U.S.A.?”he asked.

Islamic Fascism

Speaking as Islamic State fighters battled their way across Iraq, seizing territory and shocking American and European officials, Mr. Bannon repeatedly stated that the United States was in a ''global war'' with radical Islam, which he sometimes describes as ''Islamic fascism.'' He emphasizes their targeting of Christians and their use of contemporary social media:

Now that call converges with something we have to face, and it's a very unpleasant topic, but we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.

If you look at what's happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if you look at the sophistication of which they've taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at what they've done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fund-raise, and to use crowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they have had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They have driven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that we're putting up later today on Breitbart where they've took 50 hostages and thrown them off a cliff in Iraq.

That war is expanding and it's metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is, unfortunately, something that we're going to have to face, and we're going to have to face very quickly.

What ISIS Wants

Mr. Bannon discusses the hopes of the Islamic State,also known as ISIS or ISIL, to slaughter people in Western Europe and the United States:

They have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a ''river of blood'' if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is going to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it's going to come to Western Europe, it's going to come to the United Kingdom. And so I think we are in a crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.

Secularism

Asked whether ''secularism or the Muslim world'' posed the greater threat to Judeo-Christian civilization, Mr. Bannon links the two:

It's a great question. I certainly think secularism has sapped the strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals, right?

If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-Christian West and its tenets, oftentimes, particularly when you deal with the elites, you're looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength.

But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was -- and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them -- we have to face a very unpleasant fact: And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that's already global. It's going global in scale, and today's technology, today's media, today's access to weapons of mass destruction, it's going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn't act.

Vladimir Putin

A questioner asks about Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Mr. Bannon gives a mixed answer -- rejecting Mr. Putin's corruption but suggesting that ''the Judeo-Christian West'' could learn from his ''traditionalism.''

I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West really have to look at what he's talking about as far as traditionalism goes -- particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism -- and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it's what can see us forward.

Western Response

Asked how the West should respond to the threat from radical Islam and ''not lose itself in the process,'' Mr. Bannon for the first time drops the adjectives and talked simply about the ''struggle against Islam.'' He connects the current world situation to centuries-old conflicts between Christianity and Islam.

I believe you should take a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that's fine.

If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West.

Historic Conflict

Mr. Bannon is referring to two historic victories of Christian forces over Muslim attackers: One was in 732 in Tours, France, when Charles Martel successfully fought off Muslim horsemen under Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. The other was in 1529, with the failed siege of Vienna by the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Mr. Bannon calls on his fellow Catholics to act during what he describes as a ''crisis.''

And I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and drivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when people 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you've taken -- and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-Christian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of that and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was bequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican, see what's been bequeathed to us -- ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they going to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning stages of this crisis?

Call to Action

In conclusion, Mr. Bannon presses his call for action -- without making clear what sort of action he seeks -- but also warns against what he calls ''our baser instincts.''

Because it is a crisis, and it's not going away. You don't have to take my word for it. All you have to do is read the news every day, see what's coming up, see what they're putting on Twitter, what they're putting on Facebook, see what's on CNN, what's on BBC. See what's happening, and you will see that we're in a war of immense proportions. It's very easy to play to our baser instincts, and we can't do that. But our forefathers didn't do it, either. And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think it's incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role is in this battle that's before us.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Pointing to Trump, Groups Reject U.S. Aid to Fight Extremism

WASHINGTON —ommunity groups in Michigan and Minnesota have decided to reject hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal aid to fight violent extremism because of what they call the Trump administration’ vilification of Muslims.

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups.

The group in Minnesota decided to reject the money after Trump administration officials were reported to be considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. The effort, now known as Countering Violent Extremism, or C.V.E., would be renamed Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, Reuters reported on Thursday.

That group, Ka Joog, which works with Somali youths in Minneapolis, said in a statement that its board had decided not to take the nearly $500,000 it was awarded last month because it believed that its efforts had “een hindered by the Trump administration to instill fear, uncertainty and anti-Muslim sentiments.”

The Michigan group, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, in Dearborn, said it would also reject $500,000 in federal aid. Suehaila Amen, an executive board member, said that her group had already been discussing before the Reuters report came out whether to accept the grant, because some in the community see the hotly disputed program as a way to spy on Muslims. But the decision was sealed by Mr. Trump’ statements and actions, Ms. Amen said.

“ou’e talking about a president who has maligned the Muslims throughout the entire campaign,”he said. “e don’ feel like we need to compromise our integrity, transparency and integrity in the community for some money or funding.”

Another organization, the Muslim Public Affairs Council Foundation, which has offices in Washington and Los Angeles, said it was waiting to see whether the administration moved forward with changes to the program before deciding whether to keep its nearly $400,000 grant.

And Jihad Turk, the president of Bayan Claremont, a graduate college in Claremont, Calif., for Muslim scholars and religious leaders, said it would not accept its $800,000 grant, one of the largest awarded, if the administration renamed the program and entirely shifted it focus.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment, though people briefed on the matter said there was fierce resistance inside the department against making changes to the program that could further alienate Muslim communities assisting antiterrorism efforts. During his confirmation hearing as department secretary last month, John F. Kelly stressed the need to build trust with Muslim communities.

But the administration’ possible move aligns with Mr. Trump’ campaign promises to defeat what he called “adical Islamic terrorism,”s well as with the views of some of his advisers. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’ top strategist, has said that Islam is not a religion of peace, while Mr. Trump’ national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, once said that fear of Muslims was rational.

Counterterrorism experts say that the administration risks eroding years of bridge building between the government and Muslim communities, which have long been suspicious of the counterextremism programs.

“oing forward, Muslim communities may fear that information provided for C.V.E. programs and target audiences will be used instead for surveillance, prosecution and/or deportation,”aid J. M. Berger, a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague and co-author of “ISIS: The State of Terror.”“hose fears may now be justified.”

Erroll G. Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States.

Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. From 2009 to 2016, according to figures from the Anti-Defamation League, these groups accounted for 84 percent of the extremist violence in which shots were exchanged with law enforcement.

“ata should dictate policy,”r. Southers said. “f you ignore data, you ignore the real problem, which is that extremism comes from a diverse range of sources.”

The federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations saying they stigmatize entire communities.

In Minneapolis, some groups have participated in a program run by the local United States attorney to counter Islamic State propaganda efforts directed at Somalis. But other groups have criticized the government’ efforts, saying they are overwhelmingly focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities and pay little attention to the threats posed by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists.

Faiza Patel, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent Extremism Program would make a bad project worse.

“t makes explicit what was already implied in C.V.E.,”he said. “ow all of that window dressing goes out the door.”

Despite millions of dollars in government-sponsored research, there remains no consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist or how to identify such people before they attack.

Clark R. McCauley Jr., a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years, said that programs to counter extremism were already too focused on Islamic terrorism. “t’ not all that easy to get money to study right-wing stuff,”e said. “here’ a big oversupply of attention to Islamic extremism as it is.”

Making that focus more explicit may not significantly change how the programs operate, he said. “ut what it will mean for Muslims in the U.S., that’ going to be a problem, even if the machinery doesn’ change,”rofessor McCauley said. “t means the country has decided to say, ‘ou people are a special threat.’”

Christian Picciolini, the founder of Life After Hate, a Chicago group devoted to countering right-wing extremism, said it would be dangerous to minimize white extremism, pointing to gunmen like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and Wade Michael Page, who killed six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.

“hey are being radicalized by fake news and conspiracy theories,”e said of such attackers. “e are ignoring a massive domestic terrorism problem that already exists in our borders.”

The art of the deal in Afghanistan

The United States can best achieve its objective of denying international terrorists sanctuary in Afghanistan by implementing an integrated diplomatic and military strategy.

The immediate goal is to defend the country's government and strategic assets. In the medium run, we need to continue trying to stabilize that country's shaky political order and keeping its state and security forces trained and funded. Over the long term, the United States would have to support efforts to build a more self-sufficient economy linked to Afghanistan's neighbors.

A political settlement, not just with the Taliban but also with Pakistan and other regional states, is essential for moving beyond the medium term. Reaching a settlement would require the United States to keep an open-ended troop presence as its main bargaining chip, while demonstrating willingness to discuss and negotiate a timetable for complete troop withdrawal with Afghanistan, its neighbors and the Taliban.

Some Americans and Afghans, looking only at the short run, hope President Trump will strengthen the position of the United States and the Afghan government against the Taliban. Mr. Trump discussed sending more troops in a December telephone call with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, The Wall Street Journal reported. He may exert stronger pressure on Pakistan to stop harboring the Afghan Taliban and employ tougher military measures against the Taliban in Afghanistan, though there is no basis for believing that either of those measures would work better than they have for the past 15 years.

Hopes that Mr. Trump would sustain such fruitless measures fly in the face of his own words. In October 2015 he told Chris Cuomo of CNN that Afghanistan was a ''mess'' and that ''we made a terrible mistake getting involved there.'' Mr. Trump added that he ''would leave the troops there, begrudgingly.''

The United States has 8,400 troops in Afghanistan and finances the Afghan security forces and the rest of the state at a cost estimated to be around $4 billion a year. The Trump administration is unlikely to sustain that level of spending, since it is reportedly considering how to cut federal spending by $10.5 trillion over 10 years.

Stabilizing Afghanistan with less United States assistance would require an end to Pakistan's harboring the Taliban and a political settlement in Afghanistan. But geographic and geopolitical factors limit how much the United States can pressure Pakistan. The United States needs Pakistan for access to landlocked Afghanistan. In 2011, after several incidents, Pakistan closed United States ground transit. Access through Iran is impossible. In 2011 Russia allowed supplies to transit to Afghanistan from the north. Today, it would either refuse or exact a heavy price, probably in Europe. Is Afghanistan more important than NATO?

Efforts to change Islamabad's behavior work best in cooperation with its ''all-weather friend,'' China. Senior officials in Beijing told me last December that China's cooperation with the United States in Afghanistan would continue regardless of differences over the South China Sea, North Korea or trade. Challenging the ''One China'' policy, as Mr. Trump has started to do, would end all United States-China cooperation, including on Afghanistan.

The administration's counterterrorism policy would make a political settlement impossible, which is probably fine with Mr. Trump. A peace process requires differentiating the Taliban from global jihadists, integrating the former so as to isolate the latter. The leaked draft of an executive order to revive torture and re-establish black sites, however, referred to ''a global armed conflict with ISIS, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other associated international Islamist terrorist groups,'' and made no distinction among them.

Any effort presupposes a United States presence, however begrudging, in Afghanistan. Anti-Taliban Afghans have seen the United States as a protector rather than occupier, but will their welcome survive an American president who believes ''Islam hates us'' and bars Muslim refugees from our shores?

In March 2011, when Terry Jones, a Florida pastor, burned copies of the Quran, demonstrators in Mazar-i-Sharif killed seven United Nations employees. In February 2012, American guards at the Bagram detention center burned ''extremist publications'' that turned out to be copies of the Quran and religious tracts. Two thousand demonstrators gathered outside Bagram, demanding the departure of United States troops. Over the coming weeks, Afghan soldiers killed at least six American soldiers in apparent retaliation.

The United States could quickly wear out its welcome as the Trump administration bars Muslim refugees. Any moves to send new prisoners to Guantáamo, torture detainees, inflict more civilian casualties, bar Afghans from entering the United States, tolerate or encourage the persecution of Muslims in the United States, or move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem will hurt American ability to work in Afghanistan.

Expanding the economy requires cooperation with neighbors to connect Afghanistan to markets. Regional states have started infrastructure projects that could do so. China's Belt and Road Initiative will link western China to the Middle East, Europe, Central Asia and South Asia. It includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (C.P.E.C.) from Xinjiang to the Gwadar port on Pakistan's Arabian Sea shore. Crises in United States-China or United States-Pakistan relations would make Afghan integration with C.P.E.C. even harder than it is now.

Afghanistan has an alternative to C.P.E.C. Iran and India are developing the Iranian port of Chabahar and connecting it to Afghanistan's main highway. The three countries signed a transit agreement last May. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, concerned about the Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean, visited New Delhi in January to confirm Japanese participation. On Jan. 28, thanks to the relaxation of sanctions after the nuclear agreement, Iran announced contracts for $3.2 billion in direct investment in projects on the coast around Chabahar. President Trump could cooperate with India and Japan, but additional sanctions on Tehran could hinder investment in Chabahar and inhibit implementation of the transit agreement.

If America is first on Mr. Trump's list of priorities, the ''mess'' in Afghanistan seems to be pretty far down. Afghanistan's future will depend on the United States as much as it will on China, India, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. The United States could help shape regional arrangements that would do more to stabilize Afghanistan and stop terrorism than a thousand drone strikes, but not if we view our presence solely as part of a global war on Islamist terrorism and make it impossible to engage Afghanistan's neighbors.

After Visa Ban, Hints of Hidden Tension on Mississippi Campus

STARKVILLE, Miss. -- Coming from an Iranian city of around 150,000 people, Amir Rezazadeh felt a little out of place when he arrived at Mississippi State University, more than 100 miles from any metropolitan area and deep in the heart of the Bible Belt.

But he soon came to like the quiet surroundings, where there was little to distract him from his horticulture studies, and where there was already a group of Middle Eastern students and professors to make him feel welcome.

Ignoring half-serious warnings that he could be converted, he even began spending time at the Baptist Student Union, where he honed his English, discussed Christianity and Islam, played games and watched movies, and forged friendships with some of the Mississippi-born students.

That is why he was more than a little taken aback this past week when students told him to his face that they agreed with President Trump's order to temporarily ban visa holders from Iran and six other countries from entering the United States.

''Some people say directly to you that it's a good order,'' he said, ''that our country should have this order to ban terrorists.'' He finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.

An estimated 17,000 students in the United States are touched by the ban, many of them in universities in the Northeast and California, where support for the president's move has been thin. But there are also sizable numbers in universities like Mississippi State, out-of-the-way pockets in states that voted for Donald J. Trump.

The move may be bringing to the surface hidden tensions between ambitious Middle Eastern students who have been welcomed to the United States with scholarships and job opportunities, and fellow students and other residents who believe the threat of terrorism necessitates a second look at who is let into the country.

The Mississippi State president, Mark E. Keenum, in a carefully worded statement that avoided the overt criticism of some counterparts at other universities, said that the university would try to help the students affected by the order and that its ''core values of diversity, inclusion, tolerance and safety for all -- regardless their country of origin -- do not waver or change.''

That was a different message from that of the governor, Phil Bryant, who has said there were ''a lot of people overreacting'' to what he believed was a reasonable pause in immigration from the seven countries.

Many students and alumni, on Facebook and in public, have expressed support for Mr. Trump's move. Zach Cooke, 21, an electrical engineering major from Amory, Miss., said that while the ban's execution was poor, ''With what's going on at the moment, I think a limit on who can come into the country is not a bad idea.''

At the same time, a vocal segment of the school and town -- county voters went narrowly for Hillary Clinton in a state that was heavily pro-Trump -- has expressed support for the affected students. At a vigil Wednesday night, about 250 people gathered on an open green near the football stadium, carrying candles and holding signs. ''Immigrants make America great,'' read one.

One organizer, a veterinary medicine student named Anna Walker, said she was inspired by a photograph of a protest at Washington Square Park in New York. ''I realized that we needed a show of support in smaller communities,'' Ms. Walker, 26, said.

Once known solely for its agriculture program -- even today fans ring cowbells at football games, and prized herds of cows graze on campus pastures -- Mississippi State has worked in recent years to excel in technology and engineering, recruited scientists from all over the world to its 21,000-student campus and attracted hundreds of millions in dollars in research money, much of it from the federal government.

The foreigners who live and work here include many Muslims; an unprepossessing mosque operates in a converted house on a residential street, and there are regular gatherings for holidays like Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

The executive order, signed Friday, barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It halted admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and that of other refugees for 120 days. Though students from those countries can stay, for now, they fear that they cannot leave the United States because they would not be allowed back in, and they wonder how any new vetting procedures being considered by the Trump administration might affect their future studies and travel.

''Most people are distracted from school,'' said Erfan Alkamil, 25, a senior who received a scholarship from the Yemeni government. ''Some have been watching the news all day long. They are waiting to read something that might change the situation, or at least make them comfortable.''

Mr. Alkamil, like other Middle Eastern students, said they have generally found Mississippi State to be welcoming, even accommodating. His American friends assumed -- correctly -- that as a Muslim, he did not drink alcohol and now offer him juice instead of wine without even asking.

Adjustments are needed, though; there is no halal food market, so Mr. Alkamil has learned to like Subway sandwiches, and group meals are often held in private homes. Several of the students said the hardest acclimation was to Southern accents.

Negative interactions are rare, students said, but they happen. Kimia Mortezaei, 29, who just finished her Ph.D. in civil engineering, recalled how at the farmer's market one day, an older woman stopped her to compliment her on her ''beautiful'' dress and asked where she was from. She replied that she was from Iran, and the woman asked what she planned to do after she finished her studies.

''I said I prefer to stay here,'' Ms. Mortezaei recalled. ''She suddenly told me aggressively, 'You have to return to your country because you endanger our safety, because you're a Muslim and you're a terrorist like ISIS.''

What this stranger could not know, she added, was that she had left Iran precisely because she disagreed with Iranian politics. ''I left Iran because of those problems, and now we are labeled a terrorist,'' Ms. Mortezaei said.

Fear of terrorism is indeed a theme in comments and Facebook posts from students, local residents and alumni who support the ban. Numerous people have brought up the case of two recent Mississippi State students -- one a convert to Islam, the other a longtime resident in town whose father was a well-known Muslim community leader -- who were arrested in 2015 and later sent to prison for plotting to join ISIS.

Even with his finely threaded statement, Mr. Keenum, the university's president, has been criticized. This 1983 graduate's Facebook response was typical: "President Keenum needs to stand up for the nation's security.'' (Mr. Keenum, through a spokesman, declined an interview request.)

Outwardly, the campus remains a picture of idyllic detachment from the nation's larger tumult. On Wednesday the Baptist Student Union held its weekly $3 lunch and prayer meeting. With dogwood and Japanese magnolia trees already in full bloom, many students were wearing shorts.

An exception was one woman who made her way across campus dressed in a niqab -- a head covering with only her eyes showing. The woman, who would not give her name but said she was from Saudi Arabia, a country not covered by the ban, said she was very anxious about her future in the United States and called the president's move ''against humanity.''

Ashkan Khalili, 33, an Iranian about to graduate from his aerospace engineering doctoral program, is also beginning to fret. He will soon graduate from his doctoral program and his permit will expire. But he said he was hoping to stay and work in the United States, and repay the country for its hospitality. ''Now the question is, do they want me to pay it back, or go back?'' he asked.

Vahid Daghigh, 32, a Ph.D. engineering student from Iran, said he suddenly found himself feeling jealous of international students not from the seven countries.

''For sure, I will try to stay here,'' Mr. Daghigh said. ''But if not, I will go to Canada.''

Kimia Mortezaei, an Iranian with a Ph.D. in civil engineering, told of an episode at a local market. (A1); Amir Rezazadeh and his wife, Telmah, at the Mississippi State University campus in Starkville. ''Some people say directly to you that it's a good order,'' he said, ''that our country should have this order to ban terrorists.''; Vahid Daghigh, a Ph.D. engineering student. ''For sure, I will try to stay here,'' he said. ''But if not, I will go to Canada.''; Ashkan Khalili, an Iranian about to graduate from an aerospace engineering program, had hoped to stay and work in the United States.; About 250 gathered at Mississippi State Wednesday to support students affected by a travel ban.

An Apology to Muslims

Whenever an extremist in the Muslim world does something crazy, people demand that moderate Muslims step forward to condemn the extremism. So let's take our own advice: We Americans should now condemn our own extremist.

In that spirit, I hereby apologize to Muslims. The mindlessness and heartlessness of the travel ban should humiliate us, not you. Understand this: President Trump is not America!

I apologize to Nadia Murad, the brave young Yazidi woman from Iraq who was made a sex slave -- but since escaping, has campaigned around the world against ISIS and sexual slavery. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, yet is now barred from the United States.

I apologize to Edna Adan, a heroic Somali woman who has battled for decades for women's health and led the fight against female genital mutilation. Edna speaks at American universities, champions girls' education and defies extremists -- and she's one of those inspiring me to do the same.

I don't want to take Trump-as-an-extremist too far: He's not beheading anyone, and the security challenge is real. Nobody has a problem with improving safety, and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both oversaw improvements in vetting. Yet Trump tackled the issue in a way that bolsters the ISIS narrative and thus makes us less safe.

In effect, Trump took a real problem, inflated it with hysteria, handled it with incompetence and created an unjust policy that targets seven mostly impoverished Muslim countries that haven't produced a single person involved in a lethal terrorist attack in America since before 9/11. Islamophobia swirls through the order, and Rudy Giuliani has helpfully explained that Trump asked him to devise a way to create a Muslim ban and ''do it legally.''

There's a certain symmetry here.

I've sat down in mosques in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and heard jihadists justify intolerance. Those men (always men!) ''otherize'' infidels as fundamentally different, as threats who must be confronted; Trump ''otherizes'' Muslims in a similar way.

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Flynn, has referred to Islam as a ''cancer'' and has shared a video asserting that Islam ''wants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.'' That's the mirror image of the bigotry I hear from jihadists who tell me that Jews were behind the 9/11 attacks.

The real chasm is not between Muslims and others, but between the moderates and the extremists of whatever religion.

A Reuters poll found that many Americans approve of Trump's travel ban, but that's not surprising. The same was true of barring Jewish refugees in the 1930s, and of interning Japanese-Americans in 1942. When we're fearful, we're vulnerable to politicians who play on our fears and scapegoat immigrants; in the fullness of time, we come to regret our xenophobic behavior and to appreciate the immigrants.

So I apologize to Muslims. I have seen the worst of Islam, but also the best.

The newly chosen Rhodes scholars include a Somali refugee, Ahmed Ahmed, who was born in a Kenya refugee camp and was admitted to the U.S. as a 1-year-old. Raised by a struggling single mom, sometimes showing up at high school at 5:30 a.m. to study, he attended Cornell and won the university's outstanding student award. Such people don't threaten us, but enrich us.

If we need an inspiring example of how moderates can successfully challenge extremists, consider an extraordinary Somali gynecologist, Dr. Hawa Abdi, who ran a displaced persons camp in Somalia, including a 400-bed hospital (and a jail for men who beat their wives). Islamic militants, enraged that a woman was running such an important enterprise, ordered her to hand it over. When she refused, 750 armed militants from the Party of Islam attacked the camp and ordered Dr. Abdi to run it under their direction. She refused.

Yet Dr. Abdi's camp, serving 90,000 people, was just about the only thing working properly in Somalia, and Somalis at home and around the world united to denounce the militants and speak up for her. The pressure on the gunmen grew. Finally, they slunk off.

If Somalis can stand up to extremists, we can, too.

Indeed, that is happening. When Japanese-Americans were rounded up, other Americans were silent. Today, it is heartwarming to see Americans of all creeds standing up against similar bigotry. In Victoria, Tex., after a mysterious fire destroyed the only mosque just hours after Trump announced his travel ban, local Jewish leaders gave Muslims a key to their synagogue. Four churches also offered their space for as long as needed, and in just a few days, people of all faiths contributed $1 million to build a new mosque.

At an airport protest, one much-shared photo showed a Jewish man and a Muslim man protesting side by side, each with a child on his shoulders.

My dream is of the day when Jews protest Islamophobia, Muslims denounce the persecution of Christians and Christians stand against anti-Semitism. That's why I apologize to Muslims, and it's why ALL of us, not just Muslims, should stand up to condemn extremism in our midst.

Officials Are Cleared of Skewing  ISIS  Data

WASHINGTON -- An internal Pentagon investigation found that senior officials at United States Central Command did not deliberately skew intelligence assessments about the war against the Islamic State, despite a widespread view among analysts within the command that reports were manipulated to present a distorted view of the military campaign's progress.

The results of the investigation by the Defense Department's inspector general, released on Wednesday morning, largely exonerated the two men who led Central Command's intelligence analysis in 2014 and 2015, Maj. Gen. Steven Grove and his civilian deputy, Gregory Ryckman. Dozens of analysts at the command, known as Centcom, had anonymously accused the men of altering intelligence conclusions to paint a rosy picture of the campaign's military successes and the capability of Iraqi troops fighting Islamic State militants.

The inspector general's investigation disputed those claims.

''We did not find that anyone intentionally attempted to distort intelligence,'' the report concluded. ''Nor did we find a systematic distortion of intelligence.''

At the same time, the 190-page report sketched a portrait of a sometimes dysfunctional intelligence headquarters at Centcom, the sprawling military command in Tampa, Fla., in charge of all American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia. It also cited several examples of changes to intelligence reports that led many analysts to believe that their bosses were manipulating the conclusions.

In one instance, when Iraqi forces dropped their weapons and retreated in the face of an Islamic State attack, the word ''flee'' was deleted and replaced with ''leave.'' Another intelligence report, the inspector general found, initially said that Iraqi troops had ''lost control of'' an Iraqi city. The final version of the report said that the troops had ''ceded the severely damaged city center and repositioned troops in nearby neighborhoods.''

''These few examples became known and widely discussed, and we believe they contributed to the belief that certain words were removed from products to distort the meaning,'' the report said. ''However, we did not uncover, nor did witnesses provide, any examples of editing'' that altered the facts being presented.

The inspector general's investigation stemmed from complaints by a group of Centcom analysts, some with decades of experience working on Middle East issues, who believed that their reports were being manipulated. In September 2015, The New York Times identified Gregory Hooker, the top Iraq analyst at Centcom, as one of the leaders of the group. The complaints were taken seriously, partly because of Mr. Hooker's credibility within the military intelligence community.

Mr. Hooker has studied Iraq for two decades, and in 2005, he publicly criticized President George W. Bush's administration for pushing ''amateurish and unrealistic'' plans during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

In addition to the Pentagon's inspector general, three Republican-controlled House committees have been investigating the Centcom allegations. The chairmen of the committees issued a statement Wednesday saying the report ''confirms there were numerous problems within the Central Command.'' They cited a widespread perception that intelligence officials ''were distorting intelligence to present a more positive view of the success'' of Iraqi troops, giving an optimistic view of the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

In August, the three panels released an interim report concluding that Centcom analysts were largely justified in their concerns that senior leaders at the command had manipulated the conclusions of intelligence reports. That report offered no evidence that analysis had been changed at the behest of Obama administration officials.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said that he planned to bring the whistle-blowers before the committees to ask them about the report's findings.

''We are going to continue to do our work and give them the opportunity to come in and give us an assessment of what's in the report,'' Mr. Nunes said in a telephone interview.

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the fact that ''the whistle-blowers in this case had legitimate concerns, and even a perception of skewed intelligence, particularly among veteran analysts, is a problem that needs fixing.''

While noting that the new report ''spelled out weaknesses and flaws'' in Centcom's oversight of developing intelligence assessments, Mr. Schiff said there was ''no evidence that intelligence was falsified or that its leaders made any attempts to make the intelligence fit a political narrative.''

The Pentagon investigation, led by Glenn A. Fine, the acting Defense Department inspector general, also produced a 540-page classified report that was not released on Wednesday.

The unclassified report cited statements from intelligence officials from other parts of the government who said that Centcom intelligence reports were often more positive than others.

The top intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff told investigators that he believed Centcom had ''a more positive assessment of the effects that were being achieved against ISIL than he did from reviewing the same sources.''

But the officer told investigators that it was ''not unusual to have different viewpoints of the same facts.''

DARK AT THE CROSSINGBy Elliot Ackerman 237 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.

“he age of the war correspondent as hero,”hillip Knightley famously wrote in his book “he First Casualty,”“ppears to be over.”ccording to Knightley, Vietnam was the high-water mark for the self-mythologizing and self-aggrandizing descendants of the war correspondent Ernie Pyle, mowed down by the Japanese on the island of Ie Shima in 1945. Since then, he argued, governments at war have learned to tame their roving journalists; to exaggerate only by a certain degree, many correspondents have become variants of the press eunuchs laconically described by Evelyn Waugh in Abyssinia sitting at the hotel bar writing up the destruction of a hospital in Adowa by Italian bombers. During that war in 1936, indeed, Waugh himself received an actual cable from his editors in London concerning the “eroic nurses”upposedly killed at Adowa. It read, “equire earliest name life story photograph American nurse upblown Adowa.”o which he immortally replied, “urse unupblown.”he journalistic stenography of war had already begun.

But what, conversely, of the war literature created by Americans not implicated in the corporate machinery of reportage? It could be argued that it’ a richer harvest. And one could also argue that the most vital literary terrain in America’ overseas wars is now occupied not by journalists but by novelists and even poets: Jehanne Dubrow’ “tateside,”rian Turner’ “hantom Noise,”David Abrams’ “obbit,”adeem Aslam’ “he Blind Man’ Garden,”he stories of Katey Schultz.

Elliot Ackerman is certainly one of those novelists, and his first novel, “reen on Blue”2015), staked his claim within the terrain. Ackerman, who served in Iraq and is a recipient of the Purple Heart, now lives in Turkey. His second novel, “ark at the Crossing,”as as its setting the intricate, slow-unfolding nightmare of that paradoxical country. Based in Istanbul, Ackerman is familiar with the formidably volatile and increasingly dangerous southern border zones with Syria. Much of this slender novel is set in the once pleasant city of Gaziantep —r Antep —hose texture he renders with economical accuracy and with gathering unease. It’ a physical landscape that rarely appears in novels, and Ackerman has learned it well — twilight world of desolate roads, refugee tents, hordes of scavenging boys, desperados and lethal con men. Beyond it we hear the constant thud of artillery and mortars, a sound “ike soda cans crushed underfoot”nd a sinister whine of car alarms accidentally set off.

“ark at the Crossing”ollows the attempt of an Arab-American ex-soldier named Haris Abadi, who, after having served with the United States military as an interpreter in Iraq, is now moved to enter Syria illicitly via Turkey to fight with the Islamist militias waging war against the Assad regime. It is of course a common real-life scenario. Using a digital contact bearing the code name Saladin, he makes the attempt from Antep but fails on his first try and subsequently falls in with Amir, an exiled revolutionary, and Amir’ alluring wife, Daphne, who wants to return to Syria for her own reasons. These three sexually interconnected lost souls constitute the narrative’ emotional skeleton. Through a web of murky connections Haris manages to arrange a possible border crossing through ISIS itself (here known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh).

In some senses, Ackerman’ novel is unusual for a young writer in that it improves as it moves along rather than the reverse. The first third is heavily weighted by flashbacks relating Haris’ life in Michigan with his sister — studio in Dearborn with a foldout couch —nd his time in Iraq dominated by his relationship with another soldier. To my mind, these chop the narrative and restrain its momentum. There are also repeated descriptions and phrases that could have been ironed out more elegantly. Things improve, however, in the last half, as Ackerman allows his tale to unfold more directly and with more uncluttered velocity. The landscape —oth ruined and splendidly ancient —lso comes more into its own:

“hey left Antep, driving until the early winter sun hovered near the horizon. It cast afternoon shadows along the gentle sloping hills of Kilis Province. Where the hills spilled into farmland, herded bales of cotton spread across fields, which would remain barren until the next year. Laboring in the fields, farmers cleared and burned the harvest’ stalks. Here and there flames caught wisps of cotton, and the wisps flashed like fireflies in the day. Up ahead, dangling above the smoothly laid macadam, a single traffic light was strung across the D850. It shuffled its colors to an empty road.”

They stop here at a small shanty by the road, where a teenage acquaintance named Jamil elects to join them. In a wonderful scene, the rest of the younger boys —urious at being abandoned by their older member —ttack the car’ doors with their bare palms and then, seen recedingly through the rear window, tear their own hovel to pieces in impotent rage.

The same D850 takes Haris and his group to the ramshackle border town of Kilis, where Daesh has established a clandestine base it can use to sneak into Syria: “rom the bellied domes of the grand Canpolat, Akcurun and Ulu mosques, and from the corrugated steel roofs of backdoor shanties, the faithful had built spires, clutching their way upward. Where the D850 fed into Kilis’ smaller roads, the smooth highway came apart like a river feeding a delta, the single strip of black asphalt ceding to riven pathways of dirt and concrete. Ancient pedestrian lanes ran in all directions, their cobblestones too narrow for a car. Flitting in and out of traffic, and up through these tributary lanes, cheap Chinese motorcycles —ifans, Zongshens, Jialings —raveled past, always carrying more than a solitary rider.”

When Haris arrives at the Daesh headquarters buried inside this warren, he notices at once the portraits of martyrs pasted along the stairwell and is struck how the expressions on their faces, “agerness mixed with fear,”re indistinguishable from those on the faces of fallen American soldiers photographically exalted on the other side. He is driven to wonder what the Daesh idea of martyrdom actually is, since few outside the group appear to understand it.

“t occurred to Haris that martyrdom was an American conception. When taken in the pure Arabic, shaheed meant something different. The translation wasn’ ‘e who sacrifices himself,’lthough that was often part of it. The literal meaning was ‘e who bears witness.’tanding at the desk, waiting to check into their rooms, Haris considered Amir, Daphne and even Jamil. Watching them, he no longer felt like a voyeur in their war —e was their witness.”

Haris is interviewed by a Daesh militant named Athid, who provides a thumbnail view of the Islamist revolution in Syria and, of course, asks Haris why he would want to fight with Daesh. Seemingly convinced, despite the slight strangeness of the exchange, Athid agrees to smuggle them all into Aleppo with some laborers and accepts the money they have brought. But treachery is the rule in the Syrian badlands. When they are stopped just before dawn by a Syrian Army patrol, their reflective responses to its taunts lead to a terrible end and a realization that Daesh sometimes dresses up as its enemies to weed out false believers.

“ark at the Crossing”s unusual in that few of its characters are Western — bold move in a culture obsessed with “ppropriation.”hether this makes them convincing to an Arab ear is hard to say, but Ackerman’ decision is clearly motivated by empathy and a desire not to tell his story through characters thinking and speaking his own language. I commend him for that; he has created people who are not the equivalents of the locally exotic subjects in your average NPR story, and he has used them to populate a fascinating and topical novel.

After Visa Ban, Hints of Hidden Tension on Mississippi Campus

STARKVILLE, Miss. —oming from an Iranian city of around 150,000 people, Amir Rezazadeh felt a little out of place when he arrived at Mississippi State University, more than 100 miles from any metropolitan area and deep in the heart of the Bible Belt.

But he soon came to like the quiet surroundings, where there was little to distract him from his horticulture studies, and where there was already a group of Middle Eastern students and professors to make him feel welcome.

Ignoring half-serious warnings that he could be converted, he even began spending time at the Baptist Student Union, where he honed his English, discussed Christianity and Islam, played games and watched movies, and forged friendships with some of the Mississippi-born students.

That is why he was more than a little taken aback this past week when students told him to his face that they agreed with President Trump’ order to temporarily ban visa holders from Iran and six other countries from entering the United States.

“ome people say directly to you that it’ a good order,”e said, “hat our country should have this order to ban terrorists.”e finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.

An estimated 17,000 students in the United States are touched by the ban, many of them in universities in the Northeast and California, where support for the president’ move has been thin. But there are also sizable numbers in universities like Mississippi State, out-of-the-way pockets in states that voted for Donald J. Trump.

The move may be bringing to the surface hidden tensions between ambitious Middle Eastern students who have been welcomed to the United States with scholarships and job opportunities, and fellow students and other residents who believe the threat of terrorism necessitates a second look at who is let into the country.

The Mississippi State president, Mark E. Keenum, in a carefully worded statement that avoided the overt criticism of some counterparts at other universities, said that the university would try to help the students affected by the order and that its “ore values of diversity, inclusion, tolerance and safety for all —egardless their country of origin —o not waver or change.”

That was a different message from that of the governor, Phil Bryant, who has said there were “ lot of people overreacting”o what he believed was a reasonable pause in immigration from the seven countries.

Many students and alumni, on Facebook and in public, have expressed support for Mr. Trump’ move. Zach Cooke, 21, an electrical engineering major from Amory, Miss., said that while the ban’ execution was poor, “ith what’ going on at the moment, I think a limit on who can come into the country is not a bad idea.”

At the same time, a vocal segment of the school and town —ounty voters went narrowly for Hillary Clinton in a state that was heavily pro-Trump —as expressed support for the affected students. At a vigil Wednesday night, about 250 people gathered on an open green near the football stadium, carrying candles and holding signs. “mmigrants make America great,”ead one.

One organizer, a veterinary medicine student named Anna Walker, said she was inspired by a photograph of a protest at Washington Square Park in New York. “ realized that we needed a show of support in smaller communities,”s. Walker, 26, said.

Once known solely for its agriculture program —ven today fans ring cowbells at football games, and prized herds of cows graze on campus pastures —ississippi State has worked in recent years to excel in technology and engineering, recruited scientists from all over the world to its 21,000-student campus and attracted hundreds of millions in dollars in research money, much of it from the federal government.

The foreigners who live and work here include many Muslims; an unprepossessing mosque operates in a converted house on a residential street, and there are regular gatherings for holidays like Nowruz, the Persian New Year.

The executive order, signed Friday, barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It halted admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and that of other refugees for 120 days. Though students from those countries can stay, for now, they fear that they cannot leave the United States because they would not be allowed back in, and they wonder how any new vetting procedures being considered by the Trump administration might affect their future studies and travel.

“ost people are distracted from school,”aid Erfan Alkamil, 25, a senior who received a scholarship from the Yemeni government. “ome have been watching the news all day long. They are waiting to read something that might change the situation, or at least make them comfortable.”

Mr. Alkamil, like other Middle Eastern students, said they have generally found Mississippi State to be welcoming, even accommodating. His American friends assumed —orrectly —hat as a Muslim, he did not drink alcohol and now offer him juice instead of wine without even asking.

Adjustments are needed, though; there is no halal food market, so Mr. Alkamil has learned to like Subway sandwiches, and group meals are often held in private homes. Several of the students said the hardest acclimation was to Southern accents.

Negative interactions are rare, students said, but they happen. Kimia Mortezaei, 29, who just finished her Ph.D. in civil engineering, recalled how at the farmer’ market one day, an older woman stopped her to compliment her on her “eautiful”ress and asked where she was from. She replied that she was from Iran, and the woman asked what she planned to do after she finished her studies.

“ said I prefer to stay here,”s. Mortezaei recalled. “he suddenly told me aggressively, ‘ou have to return to your country because you endanger our safety, because you’e a Muslim and you’e a terrorist like ISIS.”

What this stranger could not know, she added, was that she had left Iran precisely because she disagreed with Iranian politics. “ left Iran because of those problems, and now we are labeled a terrorist,”s. Mortezaei said.

Fear of terrorism is indeed a theme in comments and Facebook posts from students, local residents and alumni who support the ban. Numerous people have brought up the case of two recent Mississippi State students —ne a convert to Islam, the other a longtime resident in town whose father was a well-known Muslim community leader —ho were arrested in 2015 and later sent to prison for plotting to join ISIS.

Even with his finely threaded statement, Mr. Keenum, the university’ president, has been criticized. This 1983 graduate’ Facebook response was typical: "President Keenum needs to stand up for the nation’ security.”Mr. Keenum, through a spokesman, declined an interview request.)

Outwardly, the campus remains a picture of idyllic detachment from the nation’ larger tumult. On Wednesday the Baptist Student Union held its weekly $3 lunch and prayer meeting. With dogwood and Japanese magnolia trees already in full bloom, many students were wearing shorts.

An exception was one woman who made her way across campus dressed in a niqab — head covering with only her eyes showing. The woman, who would not give her name but said she was from Saudi Arabia, a country not covered by the ban, said she was very anxious about her future in the United States and called the president’ move “gainst humanity.”

Ashkan Khalili, 33, an Iranian about to graduate from his aerospace engineering doctoral program, is also beginning to fret. He will soon graduate from his doctoral program and his permit will expire. But he said he was hoping to stay and work in the United States, and repay the country for its hospitality. “ow the question is, do they want me to pay it back, or go back?”e asked.

Vahid Daghigh, 32, a Ph.D. engineering student from Iran, said he suddenly found himself feeling jealous of international students not from the seven countries.

“or sure, I will try to stay here,”r. Daghigh said. “ut if not, I will go to Canada.”

Honey, Soap and Towels: Signs of Welcome That a Refugee Family Will Not See

CORRECTION APPENDEDVanessa Crawford's list for Costco this week included these items:

Toilet paper.

Paper towels.

Garbage bags.

Dish soaps.

Detergent.

Bulk jar of honey.

That was Ms. Crawford's share of the shopping for a Syrian family of three: a grandmother, 78, her daughter, 52, and granddaughter, 16, who fled Damascus four years ago and were due to take refuge, at last, in the United States next week. (The daughter's husband died in Damascus of natural causes, a relative said.)

Their resettlement was being sponsored by a community group in the Spring Glen section of Hamden, Conn.

''We had a list, like a wedding registry, of all the things we needed to set up house for a family,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''Those are the things I signed up for.''

Money was needed, too, to help pay for housing while the family got on its feet. Last Tuesday, the group -- called the Spring Glen Alliance for Refugee Settlement, which is allied with the Spring Glen United Church of Christ -- started to raise funds online through Crowdrise. By Friday, it had collected more than $10,000, said Megan Khan, a member of the group.

Three synagogues in the area had also sponsored refugee families. In other cities and towns, apartments were rented, furnished and made ready, some by faith groups, some by neighbors. But in all these cases, the families were not chosen by religion, or country of origin, but by their need.

These sponsors were a neighborhood or a parish or a congregation, the United States, pixel by pixel. At that local, practical level, executive orders on refugees are not baffling pronouncements, indifferent to human needs, but shopping lists for dish detergent and diapers and too many rolls of paper towel.

The Syrian family bound for Connecticut had been living in Jordan since leaving Syria in 2013, said Ghassan Atohmashli, a distant cousin who lives in West Haven and provided a valuable credential in the United States approval process: a family tie. Mr. Atohmashli and his relatives are clients of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, or Iris, an agency that resettles refugees in Connecticut and collaborates with the community and religious groups to get newcomers set up.

''They were going to go to Cairo on Feb. 6 and then to the United States,'' Mr. Atohmashli said.

That was to be the end of a long process that began with an application to a United Nations commission for refugee status in 2013. A ruling that someone is a refugee can take years, and periodically requires new interviews. After that, the United States screening process begins. A State Department website describes the process:

''U.S. Security screening of all refugees involves multiple U.S. agencies, including the Departments of State, Homeland Security (DHS), and Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Counterterrorism Center, the Terrorist Screening Center, and two federal intelligence agencies,'' according to a State Department fact sheet dated Jan. 20.

After months of questioning and paperwork, the family was approved. They bought three airline tickets at $950 each, Mr. Atohmashli said. On Friday, just as the Spring Glen group had topped $10,000 in its fund-raising, President Trump issued an executive order that indefinitely barred all immigration by people who had come from Syria.

''They don't know how they are going to survive in Jordan,'' Mr. Atohmashli said. ''The mother works a bit, but she can't do everything, and the older woman can't work.''

The executive order does not frame the new restrictions in religious terms, but was issued in a context that could hardly have been more explicit. One of the president's advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Mr. Trump wanted a ban on Muslims but needed ''the right way to do it legally.'' During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised a ''total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States'' until officials had studied the matter. And Mr. Trump said last week in an interview that Christian refugees would be given priority for visas.

The existing vetting process gave ample opportunity to identify people with terrorist inclinations, Mr. Atohmashli said. ''They ask you a hundred questions, from the first meeting, they could tell if you are ISIS,'' he said. ''Or at least from the second.''

To Chris George, the executive director of the resettlement agency, the explanation for their sudden exclusion was obvious. ''Wrong nationality,'' he said.

Mr. Atohmashli, who came to the United States last year, said he had no regrets about his move. ''Every government is different from its people,'' he said. ''I know this isn't coming from the American people.''

He had seen firsthand the Americans and their shopping lists.

Correction: February 2, 2017, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The About New York column on Wednesday, about the challenges of resettling refugees under President Trump's recent executive order, misstated part of the name of a refugee agency in Connecticut. It is the Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, not the Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Assistance. The article also misspelled the surname of a member of a group that helped to raise money for refugees. She is Megan Khan, not Kahn.

This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump.

Farhiyo Hassan was watching TV coverage of President Trump’ ban on refugees from majority-Muslim countries last Friday when she heard that four students at her high school had been victims of a hate crime.

The ninth graders, who are black, were walking to a bus stop when they encountered a white teenager who allegedly made a racist remark, attacked two of the students and threatened them with a knife. Police are investigating the incident.

Ms. Hassan, who is Muslim, was heartbroken over the ban, and news of an attack on fellow students at Casco Bay High School in Portland, Me., made her feel even worse. But as a student representative on the local school board, she knew it was her responsibility “o not really break but to try to comfort other people.”

On Monday, she helped organize a march to support the ninth graders. Over half the school’ nearly 400 students joined with teachers, the district superintendent and even the mayor to march from the school to the bus stop. Students chanted “hen they go low, we go high”nd, Ms. Hassan’ favorite: “o hate, no fear. Everyone is welcome here.”

When they got to the bus stop, it was covered with signs with messages like, “e are here with you”nd “ou are loved.”s. Hassan doesn’ know who put them there, but her hunch is that it was someone associated with the school.

She also believes the march was just one example of how communities will come together in the face of hate and policies that promote it. “he one thing that this administration cannot take away from us, the one single thing that it cannot touch, is love.”

Here are some reports of hate crimes and harassment that have drawn public attention in recent days.

• man has been charged with hate crimes after allegedly attacking a Muslim employee at Kennedy International Airport last Wednesday night and shouting expletives about Islam and ISIS.

•wo threatening notes were found last Thursday at a center in Aurora, Colo., that provides services for refugees. The notes both read, “e’e gonna blow up all of you refugees.”olice are investigating the incident.

•n Jan. 25, a woman in Spokane, Wash., found a sign in her front yard reading “hite lives matter more.”he believes it was a response to a Black Lives Matter sign in her yard. “t’ definitely disheartening,”she said, “ecause I just came back from spending five days in Washington, D.C., where I marched for immigrant and refugee rights, because I’ the daughter of a Mexican immigrant.”

•n Jan. 23, graffiti including an anti-Trump message and an upside-down cross was found at the office of an anti-abortion group in St. Paul, Minn. .

•eginning last week, a man was seen wearing a swastika armband on the University of Florida campus. Last Thursday, two men allegedly attacked him and stole the armband. Last Friday, another man was seen on campus wearing a jacket with a large swastika on the back.

• man has been charged with a hate crime after allegedly threatening a woman on the basis of her religion and nationality at her workplace in Iowa City on Saturday. He also allegedly made sexual comments to her.

If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project. The form is not a report to law enforcement or any government agency. These resources may be helpful for people who have experienced harassment. If you witness harassment, here are some tips for responding. You can contact This Week in Hate at weekinhate@nytimes.com.

DARK AT THE CROSSING

By Elliot Ackerman

237 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.

“he age of the war correspondent as hero,”hillip Knightley famously wrote in his book “he First Casualty,”“ppears to be over.”ccording to Knightley, Vietnam was the high-water mark for the self-mythologizing and self-aggrandizing descendants of the war correspondent Ernie Pyle, mowed down by the Japanese on the island of Ie Shima in 1945. Since then, he argued, governments at war have learned to tame their roving journalists; to exaggerate only by a certain degree, many correspondents have become variants of the press eunuchs laconically described by Evelyn Waugh in Abyssinia sitting at the hotel bar writing up the destruction of a hospital in Adowa by Italian bombers. During that war in 1936, indeed, Waugh himself received an actual cable from his editors in London concerning the “eroic nurses”upposedly killed at Adowa. It read, “equire earliest name life story photograph American nurse upblown Adowa.”o which he immortally replied, “urse unupblown.”he journalistic stenography of war had already begun.

But what, conversely, of the war literature created by Americans not implicated in the corporate machinery of reportage? It could be argued that it’ a richer harvest. And one could also argue that the most vital literary terrain in America’ overseas wars is now occupied not by journalists but by novelists and even poets: Jehanne Dubrow’ “tateside,”rian Turner’ “hantom Noise,”David Abrams’ “obbit,”adeem Aslam’ “he Blind Man’ Garden,”he stories of Katey Schultz.

Elliot Ackerman is certainly one of those novelists, and his first novel, “reen on Blue”2015), staked his claim within the terrain. Ackerman, who served in Iraq and is a recipient of the Purple Heart, now lives in Turkey. His second novel, “ark at the Crossing,”as as its setting the intricate, slow-unfolding nightmare of that paradoxical country. Based in Istanbul, Ackerman is familiar with the formidably volatile and increasingly dangerous southern border zones with Syria. Much of this slender novel is set in the once pleasant city of Gaziantep —r Antep —hose texture he renders with economical accuracy and with gathering unease. It’ a physical landscape that rarely appears in novels, and Ackerman has learned it well — twilight world of desolate roads, refugee tents, hordes of scavenging boys, desperados and lethal con men. Beyond it we hear the constant thud of artillery and mortars, a sound “ike soda cans crushed underfoot”nd a sinister whine of car alarms accidentally set off.

“ark at the Crossing”ollows the attempt of an Arab-American ex-soldier named Haris Abadi, who, after having served with the United States military as an interpreter in Iraq, is now moved to enter Syria illicitly via Turkey to fight with the Islamist militias waging war against the Assad regime. It is of course a common real-life scenario. Using a digital contact bearing the code name Saladin, he makes the attempt from Antep but fails on his first try and subsequently falls in with Amir, an exiled revolutionary, and Amir’ alluring wife, Daphne, who wants to return to Syria for her own reasons. These three sexually interconnected lost souls constitute the narrative’ emotional skeleton. Through a web of murky connections Haris manages to arrange a possible border crossing through ISIS itself (here known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh).

In some senses, Ackerman’ novel is unusual for a young writer in that it improves as it moves along rather than the reverse. The first third is heavily weighted by flashbacks relating Haris’ life in Michigan with his sister — studio in Dearborn with a foldout couch —nd his time in Iraq dominated by his relationship with another soldier. To my mind, these chop the narrative and restrain its momentum. There are also repeated descriptions and phrases that could have been ironed out more elegantly. Things improve, however, in the last half, as Ackerman allows his tale to unfold more directly and with more uncluttered velocity. The landscape —oth ruined and splendidly ancient —lso comes more into its own:

“hey left Antep, driving until the early winter sun hovered near the horizon. It cast afternoon shadows along the gentle sloping hills of Kilis Province. Where the hills spilled into farmland, herded bales of cotton spread across fields, which would remain barren until the next year. Laboring in the fields, farmers cleared and burned the harvest’ stalks. Here and there flames caught wisps of cotton, and the wisps flashed like fireflies in the day. Up ahead, dangling above the smoothly laid macadam, a single traffic light was strung across the D850. It shuffled its colors to an empty road.”

They stop here at a small shanty by the road, where a teenage acquaintance named Jamil elects to join them. In a wonderful scene, the rest of the younger boys —urious at being abandoned by their older member —ttack the car’ doors with their bare palms and then, seen recedingly through the rear window, tear their own hovel to pieces in impotent rage.

The same D850 takes Haris and his group to the ramshackle border town of Kilis, where Daesh has established a clandestine base it can use to sneak into Syria: “rom the bellied domes of the grand Canpolat, Akcurun and Ulu mosques, and from the corrugated steel roofs of backdoor shanties, the faithful had built spires, clutching their way upward. Where the D850 fed into Kilis’ smaller roads, the smooth highway came apart like a river feeding a delta, the single strip of black asphalt ceding to riven pathways of dirt and concrete. Ancient pedestrian lanes ran in all directions, their cobblestones too narrow for a car. Flitting in and out of traffic, and up through these tributary lanes, cheap Chinese motorcycles —ifans, Zongshens, Jialings —raveled past, always carrying more than a solitary rider.”

When Haris arrives at the Daesh headquarters buried inside this warren, he notices at once the portraits of martyrs pasted along the stairwell and is struck how the expressions on their faces, “agerness mixed with fear,”re indistinguishable from those on the faces of fallen American soldiers photographically exalted on the other side. He is driven to wonder what the Daesh idea of martyrdom actually is, since few outside the group appear to understand it.

“t occurred to Haris that martyrdom was an American conception. When taken in the pure Arabic, shaheed meant something different. The translation wasn’ ‘e who sacrifices himself,’lthough that was often part of it. The literal meaning was ‘e who bears witness.’tanding at the desk, waiting to check into their rooms, Haris considered Amir, Daphne and even Jamil. Watching them, he no longer felt like a voyeur in their war —e was their witness.”

Haris is interviewed by a Daesh militant named Athid, who provides a thumbnail view of the Islamist revolution in Syria and, of course, asks Haris why he would want to fight with Daesh. Seemingly convinced, despite the slight strangeness of the exchange, Athid agrees to smuggle them all into Aleppo with some laborers and accepts the money they have brought. But treachery is the rule in the Syrian badlands. When they are stopped just before dawn by a Syrian Army patrol, their reflective responses to its taunts lead to a terrible end and a realization that Daesh sometimes dresses up as its enemies to weed out false believers.

“ark at the Crossing”s unusual in that few of its characters are Western — bold move in a culture obsessed with “ppropriation.”hether this makes them convincing to an Arab ear is hard to say, but Ackerman’ decision is clearly motivated by empathy and a desire not to tell his story through characters thinking and speaking his own language. I commend him for that; he has created people who are not the equivalents of the locally exotic subjects in your average NPR story, and he has used them to populate a fascinating and topical novel.

So this is where we are, just under two weeks into the presidency of a man who has never had to report to a boss or a board, who likes to imagine he gives all the orders, who fires or sues those who complain:

An acting attorney general, Sally Yates, fired and accused of betrayal because she told her Justice Department subordinates not to defend President Trump's order closing the nation's borders to more than 200 million legitimate foreign travelers, because it targets Muslims.

A State Department where more than 1,000 career employees have publicly and lawfully dissented from that order, which they fear will weaken, not strengthen, the nation's defenses against would-be terrorists.

A Pentagon that thinks the order will needlessly alienate vital allies in conflict zones like Iraq where Americans and Iraqi Muslims are together resisting ISIS.

And all across the government, in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and even the Interior Department, a universe of federal employees rattled by directives on regulations and hiring, shaken by rumors of cuts in basic science involving energy, health and climate change, and wondering where the next edict will come from.

And of course a press secretary, Sean Spicer, with a belligerent message not just for the State Department dissenters but for any federal employee worried about Mr. Trump's rule by decree: Get with the program or get lost.

Mr. Trump's supporters thrill to see him pumping out executive orders and memorandums aimed at turning his campaign pledges into action -- building a wall, killing trade deals, gutting Obamacare and barring Muslim refugees. Yet in doing so he has not only flouted traditional policy-making machinery but, in some cases, opened the way for legal challenges.

He has issued more than a dozen orders and memorandums, often without significant review by Congress or federal lawyers, and always with little regard for the agencies responsible for overseeing the outcome. None of the relevant departments and agencies -- State, Homeland Security, Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- were asked to weigh in on creation of the Muslim ban, which was written largely by Stephen Bannon, late of Breitbart News, and Stephen Miller, a former aide to Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, whose role during the campaign was whipping up the xenophobia at rallies before Mr. Trump took the stage. Indeed, nobody in the White House thought to call most of these officials until Mr. Trump was signing the order on television.

''This gang shoots, and then they look around to see what they've hit,'' said a former senior government executive who's been fielding agency complaints. ''There's a danger not just of unintended consequences, but of significantly dangerous consequences.''

In similar fashion, the executive order inviting the Canadian company TransCanada to reapply for a permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which President Barack Obama had killed, came without consultation with the State Department, which worked on the issue for years. The order on dismantling Obamacare rattled congressional Republicans, who were recorded in a closed-door retreat last week arguing over the re-election perils of stripping Americans' health benefits without a replacement. An order freezing federal government hiring sought no input from federal agencies on how such a freeze would affect services and no guidance as to whether its exemption for military personnel included veterans, who make up nearly one-third of the civilian work force.

When he isn't beating up on the press, Mr. Spicer denigrates civil servants as ''career bureaucrats,'' and in the case of the State Department dissenters, invites them to ''question whether or not they should continue'' in their jobs, suggesting disloyalty to the official line. Yet what these employees are doing has an honorable history, dating back to the Vietnam War, when the ''dissent channel'' was established with the express purpose of encouraging unorthodox thinking. It has been used in recent years to voice disagreements over policies in Bosnia and Syria.

During Ms. Yates's Senate confirmation in 2015, Senator Sessions asked her, ''If the views a president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or deputy attorney general say no?'' Ms. Yates replied, ''Senator, I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution.'' She did that, and Mr. Trump made her pay for it.

Immigration Ban Blocks Children Most in Need

Children who are most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by President Trump's order barring entry to the United States, according to a United Nations report.

The report was released on Tuesday, but it was compiled weeks before Mr. Trump issued his order.

Unicef, the United Nations' children's agency, appealed to wealthy nations for $3.3 billion to help millions of the world's children who face starvation, displacement, conflict, disease and other humanitarian emergencies this year.

The largest share of that money -- nearly 40 percent -- is needed to help Syrian children, both those who have fled as refugees and those who are still in their country. All Syrians have been barred indefinitely from entering the United States under Mr. Trump's executive order.

Other countries where the Unicef report says children are most at risk include Iraq, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which are named in Mr. Trump's order, and Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Sudan, which are not -- though the order bars all refugees, regardless of national origin, for 120 days.

''This shows who the ban really impacts: the world's most vulnerable, women and children who are fleeing terror,'' said Jennifer Sime, a senior vice president at the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization focused on refugees. ''America is turning away from its leadership role on refugee resettlement, and it is refugees who are paying the price.''

Noting that about half the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in America so far are under 14 years old, Ms. Sime said: ''These are children from devastated cities like Aleppo. They are fleeing ISIS and barrel bombs of Assad, and America is turning its back on them.'' She was referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.

The United States, Unicef's largest donor, contributed more than $400 million to the agency in 2016. Even so, the agency's director, Anthony Lake, an American former diplomat, has been conspicuously silent since the travel ban went into effect last week.

Here is what the Unicef report says the agency needs for the five countries covered by the executive order that are also on its list for the highest risk to children.

Syria and Syrian Refugees

The United Nations says it needs around $1 billion to aid children displaced by six years of conflict in Syria.

Calling the Syrian refugee crisis ''the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II,'' Unicef says there are more than 2.2 million children living as refugees in countries neighboring Syria.

The organization is also asking for more than $300 million to help more than 5.8 million children still living in the war-torn country. It says most of that money is needed for water, sanitation, hygiene and medical aid.

Yemen

Unicef is seeking about $200 million in aid for Yemen, which is in a civil war and straining from a devastating famine. The organization says the bulk of that money would go to feed 6.9 million children this year.

Iraq

More than 5.1 million children are in need in Iraq, about one-quarter of them displaced from their homes by conflict. The United Nations is seeking about $160 million to vaccinate more than five million children under 5 against polio.

Sudan

The United Nations plans to help more than two million Sudanese children under 5 who are acutely malnourished. Unicef is seeking more than $100 million, most of it for nutrition programs.

Somalia

''Somalia remains in a state of chronic humanitarian crisis,'' Unicef said in its appeal for more than $60 million, estimating that as many as 850,000 children there who are under 5 will be acutely malnourished in 2017.

Under Trump, U.S. Is Now a Threat to Europe's Stability, Leader Warns

BRUSSELS -- The president of the European Council warned Tuesday that President Trump was a potential threat to the European Union, including the American leader's bellicose pronouncements with major geopolitical challenges like Russian aggression, China's assertiveness and international terrorism.

In a letter sent to European leaders, Donald Tusk, the council president, wrote that those factors and ''worrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable.'' He appeared to question whether the United States would maintain its commitment to European security under Mr. Trump's leadership.

''For the first time in our history, in an increasingly multipolar external world, so many are becoming openly anti-European, or Eurosceptic at best,'' Mr. Tusk wrote. The letter was released ahead of a European Union summit meeting in Malta on Friday; Mr. Tusk is responsible for setting the agenda for the meetings.

''Particularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation; with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy,'' he wrote.

The European Union has been struggling to contend with fractious internal forces. Among them: the vote by Britain to leave the bloc, the organization's failure to establish a unified response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and the debt crisis that has driven many Greeks into poverty. And then there are external pressures like Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Before the election and since taking office, Mr. Trump has lauded the vote by Britain, known as Brexit, and said the country would thrive outside the European Union. He met with Nigel Farage, a populist leader of the campaign to leave the bloc, before seeing Prime Minister Theresa May. And at one point he went so far as to suggest that Mrs. May appoint Mr. Farage as Britain's ambassador to the United States.

Mr. Trump has also praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and indicated he would pursue friendlier relations with Moscow, even as Russia encourages chaos on the European Union's eastern border.

Mr. Tusk's letter does not reflect a new policy for the European Union, and member states of the 28-nation bloc are not required to act on Mr. Tusk's advice when they meet on Friday. But many European leaders have made their differences with Mr. Trump known.

After the United States said it was temporarily blocking refugees from entering the country, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to point out to Mr. Trump the obligations of nations under the Geneva Conventions to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds. And President Françis Hollande of France said he had reminded Mr. Trump that ''the ongoing fight to defend our democracy will be effective only if we sign up to respect to the founding principles and, in particular, the welcoming of refugees.''

Mrs. May, of Britain, sought in a meeting with Mr. Trump last week to confirm his commitment to NATO; he was dismissive of the alliance, the bedrock of European security, during his campaign.

Now, the sentiments expressed in Mr. Tusk's letter are pushing European leaders' exasperation with the American president further into the public view.

Mr. Tusk has sounded the alarm about the existential crises facing the bloc before, but never with the urgency he displayed in the letter. And he has never before included a longstanding ally like the United States in the list of challenges.

''An increasingly, let us call it, assertive China, especially on the seas,'' he wrote, ''Russia's aggressive policy toward Ukraine and its neighbors, wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and in Africa, with radical Islam playing a major role, as well as worrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable.''

Much of the frustration Mr. Tusk displayed in his letter stemmed from what Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said was Mr. Trump's ''de facto supporting'' of populist forces that could further upend the European order.

Far-right populist challengers in France, Germany and the Netherlands have adopted some of his anti-establishment rhetoric in their own campaigns.

Still, Mr. Wolff said it was unwise to enter into a war of words with the Trump administration. ''We need to uphold our values here, but does it mean that we need now a declaration where we put the United States on the same level as ISIS?'' he said. ''No, I don't think so. I don't think it that would be helpful in any way.''

The trans-Atlantic volley of opprobrium on Friday included an accusation by Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump's new National Trade Council, that Germany was manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. Mr. Navarro told The Financial Times that Germany was using a ''grossly undervalued'' euro to ''exploit'' the United States and its partners in Europe.

That did not sit well with Ms. Merkel, who defended the European Central Bank's independent role at a news conference on Friday: ''Because of that we will not influence the behavior of the E.C.B. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.''

The value of the euro is near a 13-year low compared with the dollar, allowing German carmakers and other manufacturers to sell their goods more cheaply in the United States. But German firms also employ around 670,000 people in the United States, including many in a BMW factory in Spartanburg, S.C., the carmaker's largest in the world, and a Mercedes factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala. These are the sort of manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump says he wants to keep in the United States.

Jan Techau, director of the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum in Berlin, a research center dedicated to diplomacy, said Mr. Tusk's letter was less a warning to the American president than it was a message to Europeans not to be lured away from union, or to be tempted away from the bloc by favorable bilateral ties offered by the Trump administration. ''He is encouraging everyone to fall into that trap,'' Mr. Techau said of the American president.

Mr. Tusk, by contrast, is making the case for Europeans to stick together for their own survival. ''He wants to remind them that there is something bigger at stake than just what they are going to be talking about in Malta,'' Mr. Techau said.

Found Forms Give Peek at Lethal  ISIS  Drones

By ERIC SCHMITT; Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.

WASHINGTON -- The standardized four-page checklist describes each Islamic State drone mission in chillingly impassive detail: Mission type (spy, bombing, training). Location (city, province). Drone components (motor, bomb ignition). Operation (successful or not).

The form, apparently filled out by Islamic State drone operators in Iraq after every mission, was part of a batch of documents discovered in January by a Harvard researcher embedded with Iraqi troops in the battle of Mosul and then turned over to American military analysts for review.

The documents -- in Arabic and English -- offer a rare window into how the Islamic State has cobbled together a rapidly advancing armed drone program that increasingly threatens allied troops fighting the militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They show how the group has institutionalized a program using off-the-shelf technology to bedevil the militarily superior American armed forces.

The Islamic State has used surveillance drones on the battlefield for about two years. But an increase in attacks since October -- mostly targeting Iraqi troops -- has highlighted its success in adapting readily accessible technology into a potentially effective new weapon.

In the past two months, the Islamic State has used more than 80 remotely piloted drones against Iraqi forces and their allies. About one-third of the aircraft, some as small as model airplanes, dropped bombs or were rigged with explosives to detonate on the ground, said Col. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman for the American-led operation against the Islamic State in Baghdad.

Iraqi officials said bombs dropped by the drones, which were primarily quadcopters, had killed about a dozen government soldiers and injured more than 50. ''It poses a threat to troops on the ground, and it has value as a propaganda technique,'' Colonel Dorrian said of the Islamic State drone program in an email. ''However, it's certainly not a game-changer when it comes to the outcome of the battle to liberate Mosul.''

A new video message from the Islamic State, ''Knights of the Departments,'' appeared to depict these new drone missions.

The documents were discovered by Vera Mironova, an international security fellow at the Belfer Center at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Ms. Mironova obtained the documents while she was conducting research in Iraq on the individual behavior of Islamic State fighters. She said in an interview via Skype that she had come across the materials in a drone workshop formerly under the control of the Islamic State in the Muhandeseen neighborhood of Mosul, near Mosul University.

Iraqi soldiers were not interested in the documents, Ms. Mironova said. But recognizing their potential value to the American military, she contacted the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, which has previously published her work.

Two researchers at the center, Don Rassler and Muhammad al-Ubaydi, reviewed the roughly 30 pages she sent. Confirming the authenticity of documents from a war zone is always tricky. But in a nine-page assessment, an advance copy of which was provided to The New York Times along with the documents themselves, the authors concluded the materials were genuine based on where and how Ms. Mironova obtained them and the center's experience working with an array of captured battlefield material.

All of the documents appear to be from around 2015 -- the early phases of the drone program -- and the collection includes a mix of official Islamic State forms and handwritten notes, according to the researchers' analysis.

The materials reveal that the Islamic State, much like its forerunner, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, is detail-oriented and bureaucratic when it comes to its operations. According to the assessment of the documents, the Islamic State's drone unit falls under the Al Bara' bin Malik Brigade, a part of the aviation sector of the Islamic State's Committee for Military Manufacturing and Development.

The standardized four-page checklist for drone operations provided another example. On the first page, drone operators were asked to provide details about their mission -- specifically, the type of mission (there are six options, including ''Bombing'' and ''Explosive Plane''), the militants who were involved, the location and the way point coordinates for the flight.

The second page of the form consisted of a checklist that seems to have been designed to help the drone operators conduct pre- or post-mission checks of their systems and equipment (including ''Bomb Ignition sys'' and ''Bomb igniter RC''), the assessment said. The third page was a checklist of gear in the operator's ''tool case,'' including ''screwdriver,'' ''pliers'' and ''knife.''

The last page of the form asked the operators to note whether their mission had succeeded or failed. It also provided space for the operators to write notes, perhaps to document lessons learned from failed missions or interesting events that occurred during successful ones, the assessment said.

The documents also contained detailed acquisition records, essentially shopping lists for the off-the-shelf commercial technology that the Islamic State is buying.

The lists showed the group's efforts to buy items like a GoPro camera, memory cards, GPS units, digital video recorders and extra propeller blades, the assessment said. The purchasing lists also highlighted the group's efforts to enhance the range and performance of its drones, whether bought commercially or not. For example, to protect the transmission of their drone video feeds, members of the group wanted to acquire encrypted video transmitters and receivers, the assessment said.

''There seems to be a list of material necessary to the construction of those drones,'' said Damien Spleeters, head of operations in Iraq for Conflict Armament Research, a private arms consultancy that has been investigating weapons recovered from the Islamic State since 2014. Mr. Spleeters has also reviewed the documents for the West Point center. ''So it shows consistency and standardization, certainly with some sort of chain of supply in place,'' he said.

American military officials said that the Pentagon had dedicated significant resources to stopping Islamic State drones but that few Iraqi and Kurdish units had been provided with the sophisticated devices that the American troops had to disarm them. The officials said they had ordered the Pentagon agency in charge of dealing with explosive devices -- known as the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization -- to study ways to thwart hostile drones. Last summer, the Pentagon requested an additional $20 million from Congress to help address the problem.

The recovered documents offer few clues about how the militants view the future of their drones.

''In the short term, we should expect the Islamic State to refine its drone bomb-drop capability,'' the assessment concluded. ''It is likely that the Islamic State's use of this tactic will not only become more frequent, but more lethal as well.''

FIRST 100 DAYS BRIEFING
Washington; SECT
Obama Speaks Up, Praising Protests and Opposing Religious Test

â– ormer President Barack Obama , virtually silent since leaving office, spoke up on Monday, praising the surge of activism against his successor and opposing religious tests.

â– resident Trump's supporters have formed a political arm to support him -- called ''America First Policies.''

â– nited Nations says 20,000 refugees have been frozen out by President Trump's immigration executive order.

Citizen Obama praises protests, slams religious test

Former President Obama boarded Marine One after his successor's swearing-in on Jan. 20 and seemed to disappear.

On Monday, he re-emerged, pleased with the activism that has blossomed since his departure and pretty displeased at the policies that elicited that response.

Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president said:

''President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy -- not just during an election but every day. Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake. With regard to comparisons to President Obama 's foreign policy decisions, as we've heard before, the president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.''

Mr. Lewis also let it be known that Mr. Obama never, ever supported a ban on Muslim immigration. He helpfully sent out this quote from November of 2015, as Congress was moving to legislate a ban on Syrian refugees.

''When I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution -- that's shameful. That's not American. That's not who we are. We don't have religious tests to our compassion.''

America First -- again

The United States got its second America First committee on Monday afternoon.

The first was created in 1940 to keep the nation out of World War II, with its best-known associate being Charles Lindbergh, the aviator who was a vocal supporter of Nazi Germany.

The latest one was created by Mr. Trump's allies and former advisers, the America First Policies committee, an outside group that will support the president, pushing back on opposition to his stances and eventually running advertisements to support him.

The group is being led by strategists Nick Ayers and Rick Gates, as well as Marty Obst and Brad Parscale, who led Mr. Trump's digital efforts during the campaign. Two other strategists who worked with the Trump campaign, David Bossie and Katrina Pierson, will work with the group.

''President Trump campaigned on a bold but basic concept: America First,'' the statement from the group said.

''This is a concept the American people both understand and support, but few in the media recognize and many politicians beholden to special interests will oppose,'' the officials said. ''We will provide the counterbalance.''

The group appears to be officially sanctioned by the Trump apparatus, and came together after bitter debate among factions during the campaign. It is expected to be funded in part by the father-daughter donors Rebekah and Bob Mercer, two supporters of Mr. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his counselor, Kellyanne Conway.

The phrase ''America First'' was used by Mr. Trump after he won the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. He used it again in his inauguration address. Mr. Trump has said he was familiar with the negative connotations of the phrase. But he has said it captured his approach to governing.

20,000 refugees impacted by the ban, U.N . says

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said an estimated 20,000 refugees from all over the world would be impacted immediately by the executive order that freezes refugee resettlement for 120 days. Many more Syrian refugees are affected by the indefinite suspension of resettlement of Syrians.

The statement pointed to a provision in international law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion or nationality. The executive order bars nationals of seven countries, including Syria. ''The High Commissioner underlines once again'' the organization's ''position that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,'' the statement read.

"Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under #humanrights law" - @UNHumanRights Chief #Zeid pic.twitter.com/EpYpEpyYrf -- UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) January 30, 2017

It didn't help that the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, is a Jordanian -- and Jordan's king, Abdullah II, is in Washington.

The refugee agency is mandated to protect the rights of refugees. It also relies on the United States for 40 percent of its funding.

The agency said it was ''alarmed at the impact'' of the executive order.

Those who are referred for resettlement, it said, ''are the most vulnerable -- such as people needing urgent medical assistance, survivors of torture, and women and girls at risk. The new homes provided by resettlement countries are lifesaving for people who have no other options.''

United Nations officials in charge of preparing refugees for resettlement were told by the State Department on Sunday morning to plan on halting medical screenings, travel schedules and orientation sessions for all refugees in the pipeline for resettlement to the United States.

The guidance went on to explain that nationals of seven prohibited countries would not be allowed to board planes for the United States.

The backlash continues to grow

Iran has banned visas for Americans. Iraq's Parliament appears to be following suit.

Career foreign service officers have drafted a stinging dissent, declaring, ''We are better than this ban.''

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault , visiting the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Monday, declared, ''It's discrimination. We want an urgent clarification as soon as possible from the Americans.''

''This has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.''

And then there's this:

Unintended consequences have a way of getting out of hand when policies are made a bit hastily.

People are speaking out -- through The New York Times

The reaction to President Trump's executive order on immigration was unusual by at least one standard -- it attracted more comments than any article in nytimes.com history.

Judge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide received 10,363 comment submissions. Of those, 8,448 were approved by the journalists who moderate comments and posted on The Times's site.

The story, which was opened for reader submissions on Saturday morning, narrowly outpaced an October 2016 article about James Comey's surprise letter to Congress announcing that emails from Hillary Clinton 's private server had been found on Anthony Weiner's computer.

The most popular comment about Mr. Trump's executive order came from a reader called tbriggs27 in Longmont, Colo., who wrote:

''As a patriot and veteran I am sickened by this callous disregard for people who are critical to the safety of our men and women in combat. As an American I am sickened by the religious test. We can never have liberty and freedom when we deny it to others. This is unsustainable.''

That comment attracted 324 comment replies and was recommended by 9,178 registered readers of The Times.

A Supreme Court announcement on TV from the White House

The Supreme Court -- cosseted, cordial and militantly untelevised -- is going prime time on live TV, with Mr. Trump announcing on Twitter that he will announce his pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.

''I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court . It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.),'' Mr. Trump wrote on his personal Twitter account at 8:43 a.m. -- timed perfectly to catch the top-of-the-hour news roundups.

The president had originally planned to make the announcement on Thursday, but he had a rough weekend after protests over his executive order temporarily banning migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries forced the Department of Homeland Security to decree that permanent residents would, for the most part, be exempted from the crackdown.

Mr. Trump's shortlist of three federal appeals judges, culled from media accounts and confirmed by people close to the process, is: Neil M. Gorsuch of Colorado, Thomas M. Hardiman of Pennsylvania and William H. Pryor of Alabama, who was originally favored to be the pick.

I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court . It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

The president has never shrunk from the theatrical aspects of his job.

Some Iraqis May Avoid Immigration Ban

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to send the White House a list of Iraqi citizens who have served with American forces with the recommendation that they be exempt from President Trump's temporary ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, administration officials said on Monday.

The Pentagon list is intended to address a major criticism of Mr. Trump's executive order on immigration: that it will stop the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.

Some Iraqi military officials with family in the United States, who have also reportedly been affected by the decree, could also benefit from the Pentagon list, which will also be sent to Homeland Security.

Mr. Mattis was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the executive order on immigration, which temporarily blocks Iraqi citizens from entering the United States for 90 days. Six other predominantly Muslim countries are covered by the edict: Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.

The White House has argued that the temporary ban is needed so that the United States can develop procedures for the ''extreme vetting'' of travelers from nations that have been stricken by terrorism. Officials said that the Iraqis who will be put on the Pentagon list have already undergone a stringent form of vetting: serving with the United States military in combat.

Schumer's a 'no' on nominations, across the board

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, approached his new job as the anti-Harry Reid: Yes, he would fight President Trump where he needed to, but he made it clear he really wanted to find areas of cooperation.

That may not be happening.

Driven by the executive order on immigration and by the vociferous demands of the increasingly activist Democratic base, Mr. Schumer announced on Monday that he would oppose President Trump's nominees pretty much across the board: No on Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Representative Mick Mulvaney for budget director, Representative Tom Price for secretary of health and human services, Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary, Scott Pruitt for E.P.A. chief and Andy Puzder for labor secretary.

Cooperation, it seems, is over.

''After the first week of the Trump presidency it's clear our country is at a cross roads. In his first week in office the president has stomped over our proud American tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees, trafficked in alternative facts, and is attempting to fill his cabinet with billionaires and bankers. What kind of country do we want to be: one that helps the middle class and those struggling to get there or one that further rigs the system in favor of the special interests?''

It might not have helped that Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Schumer for his tearful denunciation of his immigration order.

''I noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with the fake tears,'' Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday during a meeting with small-business leaders. ''I'm going to ask him who was his acting coach, because I know him very well. I don't see him as a crier.''

Calm down, Trump says, few were detained

Besieged by criticism, with chaos at international airports mounting and protests proliferating, Mr. Trump defended the aftermath of his executive order halting immigration from the seven countries, saying that problems at airports were the fault of a Delta Airline computer error.

Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

Delta said it fixed its system problems after a few hours on Sunday night. The chaos lasted the whole weekend.

Also, if there ever was a Mr. Nice Guy, he is no more.

There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

And, the president said, he had to spring the order on the world -- the element of surprise keeps the nation safe. Also, he seems to have acknowledged that it is a ''ban,'' a term the Trump administration has denounced as hyperbole.

If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the "bad" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad "dudes" out there! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017

That swipe at Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was a reference to the senator choking up on Sunday as he recounted his family's immigrant experience.

Jewish Republican groups mildly peeved at White House

The Republican Jewish Coalition and the Zionist Organization of America have tried really hard to stay on Mr. Trump's good side.

During the campaign, when Trump supporters unloaded vicious anti-Semitic invectives on journalists, the Republican Jewish Coalition condemned expressions of hate by supporters of all candidates. The Zionist organization latched on to Mr. Trump's America First program and backed his conservative, pro-settler pick to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman.

When the White House released a statement on Friday commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day without mentioning Jews, they were pretty quiet, even as the Anti-Defamation League condemned the omission.

1/2 @WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just 'innocent people' pic.twitter.com/OXiFqcPi4V -- Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) January 27, 2017

But on Sunday, after Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, confirmed that the decision to not mention Jews in the statement was intentional, the two Jewish groups were upset, mildly. Ms. Hicks justified the decision by saying, ''Despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.''

The Republican Jewish Coalition, not exactly sputtering with rage, released a statement:

''As supporters of President Trump, we know that he holds in his heart the memory of the six million victims of the Holocaust, and is committed not just to their memory, but ensuring it never happens again.''

''The lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi's final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.''

Morton A. Klein, the national president of the Zionist organization, was a little stronger:

''Especially as a child of Holocaust survivors, I and Z.O.A. are compelled to express our chagrin and deep pain at President Trump, in his Holocaust Remembrance Day message, omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.''

Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, did not sound all that apologetic on NBC's ''Meet the Press'': ''I mean, everyone's suffering in the Holocaust, including obviously all of the Jewish people affected, and the miserable genocide that occurred is something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad and something that can never be forgotten,'' he said.

Oh, and he mentioned that some members of Mr. Trump's family -- alluding to Ivanka, his daughter, and Jared Kushner , his son-in-law -- are Jewish.

Trump's other objective: Call it ISIS

Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he had a secret plan to fight the Islamic State. Eight days into his presidency, he seems to have revealed a small part of it.

Call it ISIS.

An executive memorandum that Mr. Trump signed in the Oval Office on Saturday afternoon repeatedly referred to the Islamic State as ISIS -- not ISIL, as former President Barack Obama and the rest of the federal government called the terrorist group; and not Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the group, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it while standing next to the president last week in the East Room of the White House.

''This is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , in other words, ISIS,'' Mr. Trump said as he signed the memorandum, which called on the Pentagon to devise a ''comprehensive plan'' within 30 days.

This is a big issue for the president. As he said in late 2015, before his campaign heated up:

Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015

In May 2016, Mr. Trump again brought up the issue, saying in an interview with Bloomberg Politics: ''The president of the United States always says 'ISIL.' Everyone else says 'ISIS.' And I actually think he does it to bother people.''

Rush Limbaugh accused Mr. Obama of using ISIL to delegitimize Israel -- naturally. (Don't ask, it doesn't make sense.)

In fact, the former president thought the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was more delegitimizing than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , which denoted the territory the group holds.

Well, elections have consequences.

Republicans and the art of saying nothing

Democratic lawmakers greeted Mr. Trump's executive order barring visitors and immigrants from the seven Muslim countries with unmistakable broadsides.

To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today. pic.twitter.com/XW7sjmCcXh -- Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 28, 2017

As protests mounted and criticism grew, Republicans slowly began to speak out, but most of the coordinated response seemed to be, We like what the president is doing, and maybe he could have done things a little differently.

Take Representative Darrell Issa , Republican of California, who once called the Obama administration the most corrupt presidency in history, until Mr. Issa nearly lost his seat and claimed he had cooperated with Mr. Obama . His district appears to be getting more ethnically diverse, but it still has affluent Republican strongholds that have helped him remain in power since 2003. The statement takes the Republican nonposition to an art form:

''America is a nation of immigrants. Our country has been built by the hard work of those who've come here for liberty and to find hope in a land of opportunity. A welcoming America is not incompatible with a strong and secure America. We can put in place a vetting process that the American people have confidence in. To do so, the Congress must work with the administration to swiftly reestablish strong and clear screening procedures so that our rich tradition of immigration is not permanently threatened by those who wish us harm.''

Democrats demand investigation into Homeland Security

Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Illinois' two Democratic senators, demanded an independent investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security into the way it carried out Mr. Trump's executive order on immigration.

The call came amid reports that Customs and Border Protection repeatedly ignored judicial orders to release travelers from detention facilities at airports across the country.

''We are particularly alarmed by allegations that C.B.P. officers and potentially other department personnel failed to comply with a temporary restraining order,'' they wrote.

''The United States Constitution means little if law enforcement agents disregard it, or if Americans are unwilling to defend its principles and respect foundational constitutional rights, from due process to equal protection under the law. The American people are relying on your independent investigators to serve as a check against a powerful law enforcement agency that may be violating the civil rights of LPRs and operating in violation of the law.''

Jordanian king will have breakfast with Pence

Jordan's king, Abdullah II, is scheduled to have breakfast on Monday with Vice President Mike Pence at the vice president's residence a few miles from the White House. He would certainly like to get a little closer than that.

Amid turmoil over Mr. Trump's order to halt entries from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the king probably has issues he would like to bring up with the man signing the executive orders. But Mr. Trump does not appear keen to host Abdullah II at the White House, certainly not before Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , pays a visit.

Jordan's king will also be meeting with leaders on Capitol Hill. They are likely to get an earful.

To criticize Trump, senators lean on a friend

Maybe senators are so scared of Mr. Trump that they need a friend for support.

First, on Sunday, Senators John McCain , Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina, released a joint statement condemning Mr. Trump's executive order blocking refugees, visitors and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Of course, those two are practically their own political party -- called McGraham by some, Jindsey by others.

I'm calling John McCain & Lindsey Graham "Jindsey," as they deserve a combo name like every other celebrity couple. -- John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) February 11, 2013

Then Senators Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida, released their own buddy-gram, positing ''unanswered questions and concerns'' and some general ''uneasy'' feelings.

Sens Marco Rubio & Tim Scott issue joint statement re Trump's immigration EO, have "unanswered" questions & concerns https://t.co/qU6taxg2yZ  pic.twitter.com/kvL5ZehZCv -- Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) January 30, 2017

Of course, teaming up hasn't stopped the president from taking his shots, as he did to Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham.

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

But maybe it doesn't hurt as much when you have a friend.

To Defeat  ISIS , Arm the Syrian Kurds; Op-Ed Contributor

When President Trump presides over his first meeting of the National Security Council, possibly this week, he is likely to confront a decision whose urgency is matched only by its complexity: whether to arm Syrian Kurdish fighters poised to liberate the Islamic State’ Syrian stronghold in Raqqa.

Taking back Raqqa, along with Mosul in Iraq —here Iraqi forces backed by the United States-led coalition have freed about half of the city —ill effectively eliminate the Islamic State’ self-declared caliphate. The consequences for the Islamic State will be devastating. It will no longer control significant territory within which to train and harbor foreign fighters or exploit resources. It will lose the foundation of its most compelling narrative: the construction of an actual state.

As the noose around the Islamic State tightens, it has tried to adapt by plotting, inspiring or taking responsibility for indiscriminate attacks around the world: a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., a promenade in Nice, France, a cafe in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a square in Istanbul. Recruits are being told to stay home and attack there. Foreign fighters are being pushed out of Iraq and Syria, back to where they came from. The Islamic State directs its external operations from Raqqa. Hence, the urgency of Raqqa’ liberation.

The only fighters capable of seizing Raqqa belong to our most effective partner on the ground —he Syrian Democratic Forces, a mixture of Arabs and Kurds dominated by the People’ Protection Units, a Kurdish militia. The S.D.F. can succeed only if it is armed to overcome the Islamic State’ ferocious urban resistance of snipers, suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices.

In the last days of the Obama administration, the Pentagon said it would immediately seek permission from President Trump to do just that. It rightly wants to take advantage of the S.D.F.’ momentum in isolating Raqqa.

It is also determined to get the several hundred Special Operations forces President Barack Obama ordered into Syria the most effective partners possible.

So what’ the rub? Turkey — NATO ally and key player in Syria —assionately opposes any American support to the Syrian Kurds, especially the protection units. It is angered by the militia’ links to the Kurdistan Workers’arty, known as the P.K.K., a terrorist group that has plagued Turkey for decades.

The end of a cease-fire between the Turkish government and the P.K.K. has produced repeated attacks by the Kurdish group and a scorched-earth campaign by the government. Ankara argues that any aid the United States gives the People’ Protection Units militia will end up in the hands of the P.K.K. and be used to murder Turkish civilians.

As deputy secretary of state, I spent hours with my Turkish counterparts trying to find a modus vivendi for continuing American support to the Syrian Democratic Forces. At every juncture —rom the liberation of Manbij in northeastern Syria to the isolation of Raqqa —hey protested angrily and threatened repercussions, including denying the international coalition access to Incirlik air base and slowing counterterrorism cooperation. Anti-American rhetoric surged in the Turkish media. Each time, it took President Obama’ direct engagement with Turkey’ president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to smooth the way just enough to keep going.

If President Trump approves the Pentagon’ recommendation to arm the S.D.F., it will fall to him to keep Mr. Erdogan onboard — first, highly charged test of his diplomatic skills. There is an art to this deal.

First, Mr. Trump should make clear that he has no more urgent priority than defeating the Islamic State —nd that Raqqa cannot wait. Pushing the pause button in the illusory search for an alternative liberation force more amenable to Turkey would delay any move on Raqqa for months.

Second, any support we provide the Syrian Democratic Forces should be mission-specific —ust enough to do the job in Raqqa, not enough to risk spillover to the P.K.K. United States Special Operations forces will have to ensure the S.D.F. is using resources only for its intended purpose.

We should insist that it commit to not use any weapons against Turkey, to cede liberated Raqqa to local forces, to respect Syria’ territorial integrity and to dissociate itself from the P.K.K.

Third, keeping the S.D.F. focused on Raqqa keeps it away from the Turkish-Syrian border —nd any effort by Syrian Kurds to join the area they control in a contiguous Kurdish region or state. Turkish troops entered Syria to prevent the emergence of such a state. President Trump should clearly reiterate our own opposition to such a development.

Fourth, Turkey wants to take back the Islamic State-controlled town of Al Bab before the Syrian Kurds do. President Trump should back strong American air support for the Turkish operation there and reiterate our determination to help Turkey consolidate a broader buffer zone in northern Syria.

Fifth, Mr. Trump should double down on support for Turkey’ fight against the P.K.K., including helping find the group’ leadership holed up in Iraq’ Qandil Mountains.

Finally, the president must rethink last week’ executive order on immigration. At the very moment the Islamic State is on its heels, the order risks becoming a recruitment bonanza for jihadists while shutting America’ doors to the very people taking the fight to the Islamic State on the ground.

Mosque Killings Force Canadians to Confront a Strain of Intolerance

CORRECTION APPENDEDQUEBEC -- In a world often hostile to migration, Canada has stood out, welcoming thousands of refugees fleeing war and seeking a haven. It has been a feel-good time for Canada, proud of its national tolerance.

On Sunday, that was upended when a man walked into a mosque and started shooting, killing six people and wounding eight. The man accused of being the gunman, Alexandre Bissonnette, was charged with six counts of murder on Monday.

The nation quickly rallied after the attack. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an act of terrorism, and there was a collective outpouring of remorse and empathy. But the attack also forced Canadians to confront a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root particularly among some people in this French-speaking corner of the country.

It was also a wrenching event for a country not accustomed to mass killings and even less used to the acrimonious immigration debate that has echoed from across the United States. Before Sunday, many Canadians were watching the immigration ban there with fascination and, for the most part, disgust.

''Muslim Canadians are valued members of every community and wherever they live they deserve to feel safe; they are home here,'' Mr. Trudeau said at a memorial near the mosque in the Ste. Foy neighborhood in Monday evening's biting cold. ''We are all Canadians. Let peace unite us all.''

Yet while Canadian public figures of all stripes closed ranks quickly to reaffirm their solidarity with Muslims in Canada and tighten their embrace of multiculturalism, the killings remained a tear in the fabric of a nation in transformation.

''Canada took in roughly 30,000 Syrian refugees in a three-month period -- proportionate to the U.S. taking in 225,000 over that time,'' said David B. Harris, a lawyer and a director at Insignis Strategic Research, a counterterrorism consultancy. ''These are dramatic developments in the life of any nation.''

Mr. Bissonnette, 27, who was also charged with five counts of attempted murder, appeared at the Quebec City courthouse looking boyish in a white jumpsuit. He was not charged with terrorism, which under Canada's Criminal Code requires a broad proof of intent to intimidate the public.

The shooting was the first time anyone had been killed in a mosque in Canada in such circumstances and was, at least in recent times, a rare event outside the Muslim world. The attack was particularly shocking for Quebec City, where the bulk of the population of 750,000 works for the provincial government, universities or in tourism. Until Sunday there had not been any murders in the city for 21 months.

Mr. Bissonnette was well known to people who monitor far-right groups in Quebec, where he frequently commented on sites speaking about immigration and Islam. He was a particularly vocal supporter of Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far right, when she visited the city last year.

He was a student of anthropology and political science at Laval University, just minutes from where the shooting took place, according to people who monitored his online activities.

''He was not a leader and was not affiliated with the groups we know,'' said Françis Deschamps, a job counselor at Carrefour Jeunesse, a community organization that helps young people find jobs. Mr. Deschamps, who also runs an online group to help refugees called Bienvenue aux Réugié, said he had watched Mr. Bissonnette's anti-Muslim postings for about a year.

''The minute I saw his picture this morning, I recognized him,'' Mr. Deschamps said by telephone, adding that Mr. Bissonnette used his real name online.

Mr. Bissonnette and his family live in Cap-Rouge, a western suburb of Quebec City that lies in the shadow of a towering railroad trestle. Neighbors said there was nothing remarkable about the quiet young man.

''We knew the family for 30 years,'' said Alain Dufour, a neighbor. He said Mr. Bissonnette and his brother were ''normal kids, nothing indicating bizarre behavior.''

Even outspoken critics of the religion recoiled at the prospect that an increasingly acrimonious debate over rising Islamic immigration may have contributed to the violence.

Kellie Leitch, a conservative member of Parliament who has proposed screening immigrants for ''Canadian values,'' issued a statement calling the attack ''not just on those gathered in a house of worship but on the very fabric of Canadian society.''

Quebec has had a history of confrontations with the Muslim community. In 2005, the province became the first to explicitly ban the use of Shariah law and, less than a decade later, the Parti Quééois government tried to pass a ''charter of values'' that would have banned provincial employees from wearing Muslim head scarves and other ''overt'' religious symbols.

Quebec City, meanwhile, is a conservative bastion within the province and home to right-leaning radio talk shows that push an anti-Islam agenda -- unusual for Canadian broadcasters.

Lise Ravary, a columnist for the tabloid Journal de Montreal, said it might be time for the debate to calm down.

''I am a very vocal opponent of Islamism, and I realize now that whenever I condemn ISIS a lot of people view this as me condemning every Muslim on earth,'' she said by telephone on Monday. ''Self-censorship looms for the common good.''

Mohammed Amin, in charge of social activities at the mosque, said the community had a ''cordial relationship'' with its neighbors. He dismissed the pig's head that was left at the mosque's door last year as ''a small incident'' that could happen anywhere.

But other leaders at the mosque said there have been hate letters, and swastikas painted on its door, episodes that led to the installation of eight security cameras.

''We've had to be very, very vigilant, careful for our community,'' said Boufeldga Benabdallah, a co-founder of the mosque. Of the victims, he said, ''The prayed beside us and they were shot in the back because they prayed.''

Ste. Foy, the postwar suburb where the attack occurred, is far from the walled city center, which is stuffed with historic buildings and tourists.

The victims came from a variety of countries of origin and occupations. Azzeddine Soufiane, 57, was a butcher with a shop down the street from the mosque. Khaled Belkacemi, the oldest victim at 60, was a professor of soil and agri-food engineering at Laval University, according to members of the mosque.

Mamadou Tanou Barry, an information technology worker, and Ibrahima Barry, a provincial public servant, were brothers, Radio-Canada reported. Aboubaker Thabti, 44, came to Canada in 2011 from Tunisia and had two children. A programming analyst with the provincial government, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, was father to three daughters.

''Certainly Islamophobia has been increasing for some time,'' Samer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said by telephone from Montreal.

But he said the attack was nonetheless shocking. ''It is overwhelming, unthinkable,'' he said.

Correction: February 24, 2017, Friday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 31 about a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root in Quebec despite Canada's reputation as welcoming to immigrants misstated the surname of a columnist for Journal de Montreal who said it might be time for the immigration debate to calm down. She is Lise Ravary, not Lavary.

Trump’ Immigration Ban Blocks Children Most in Need of Aid

Children who are most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by President Trump’ order barring entry to the United States, according to a United Nations report.

The report was released on Tuesday, but it was compiled weeks before Mr. Trump issued his order.

Unicef, the United Nations’hildren’ agency, appealed to wealthy nations for $3.3 billion to help millions of the world’ children who face starvation, displacement, conflict, disease and other humanitarian emergencies this year.

The largest share of that money —early 40 percent —s needed to help Syrian children, both those who have fled as refugees and those who are still in their country. All Syrians have been barred indefinitely from entering the United States under Mr. Trump’ executive order.

Other countries where the Unicef report says children are most at risk include Iraq, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which are named in Mr. Trump’ order, and Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Sudan, which are not —hough the order bars all refugees, regardless of national origin, for 120 days.

“his shows who the ban really impacts: the world’ most vulnerable, women and children who are fleeing terror,”aid Jennifer Sime, a senior vice president at the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization focused on refugees. “merica is turning away from its leadership role on refugee resettlement, and it is refugees who are paying the price.”

Noting that about half the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in America so far are under 14 years old, Ms. Sime said: “hese are children from devastated cities like Aleppo. They are fleeing ISIS and barrel bombs of Assad, and America is turning its back on them.”he was referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.

The United States, Unicef’ largest donor, contributed more than $400 million to the agency in 2016. Even so, the agency’ director —Anthony Lake, an American former diplomat —as been conspicuously silent since the travel ban went into effect last week.

Here is what the Unicef report says the agency needs for the five countries covered by the executive order that are also on its list for the highest risk to children.

Syria and Syrian Refugees

The United Nations says it needs around $1 billion to aid children displaced by six years of conflict in Syria.

Calling the Syrian refugee crisis “he largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II,”Unicef says there are more than 2.2 million children living as refugees in countries neighboring Syria.

The organization is also asking for more than $300 million to help more than 5.8 million children still living in the war-torn country. It says most of that money is needed for water, sanitation, hygiene and medical aid.

Yemen

Unicef is seeking about $200 million in aid for Yemen, which is in a civil war and straining from a devastating famine. The organization says the bulk of that money would go to feed 6.9 million children this year.

Iraq

More than 5.1 million children are in need in Iraq, about one-quarter of them displaced from their homes by conflict. The United Nations is seeking about $160 million to vaccinate more than five million children under 5 against polio.

Sudan

The United Nations plans to help more than two million Sudanese children under 5 who are acutely malnourished. Unicef is seeking more than $100 million, most of it for nutrition programs.

Somalia

“Somalia remains in a state of chronic humanitarian crisis,”Unicef said in its appeal for more than $60 million, estimating that as many as 850,000 children there who are under 5 will be acutely malnourished in 2017.

Does Europe Have Foe in Trump White House? It May, E.U. Official Says

BRUSSELS —he president of the European Commission warned leaders Tuesday that President Trump was a potential threat to the European Union, including the American leader’ bellicose pronouncements with major geopolitical challenges like Russian aggression, China’ assertiveness on the seas and international terrorism.

In a letter sent to European leaders, Donald Tusk, the council president, wrote that those factors and “orrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable.”nd he openly questioned whether the United States would maintain its commitment to European security under Mr. Trump’ leadership.

“or the first time in our history, in an increasingly multipolar external world, so many are becoming openly anti-European, or Eurosceptic at best,”r. Tusk wrote. The letter was released ahead of a European Union summit meeting in Malta on Friday; Mr. Tusk is responsible for setting the agenda for the meetings.

“articularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation; with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy,”e wrote.

The European Union has been struggling to contend with fractious forces inside the bloc driven mainly by its failure to find a consistent, unified response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers; the difficulty resolving a debt crisis that has driven many Greeks into poverty, and external pressures like Russia’ annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

The letter does not reflect a new policy for the European Union, and member states of the 28-nation bloc are not required to act on Mr. Tusk’ advice when they meet on Friday. But many European leaders have made their differences with Mr. Trump known.

After the United States said it was temporarily blocking refugees from entering the country, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to point out to Mr. Trump the obligations of nations under the Geneva Conventions to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds. And President Françis Hollande of France said he had reminded Mr. Trump that “he ongoing fight to defend our democracy will be effective only if we sign up to respect to the founding principles and, in particular, the welcoming of refugees.”

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain sought in a meeting with Mr. Trump last week to confirm his commitment to NATO; he was dismissive of the alliance, the bedrock of European security, during his campaign.

Now, the sentiments expressed in Mr. Tusk’ letter are pushing European leaders’xasperation with the American president further into the public view.

Mr. Tusk has sounded the alarm about the existential crises facing the bloc before, but never with the urgency he displayed in the letter. And he has never before included a longstanding ally like the United States in the list of challenges.

Much of the frustration Mr. Tusk was displaying in his letter stemmed from what Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said was Mr. Trump’ “e facto supporting”f populist forces that could further upend the European order.

Mr. Trump has lauded the vote by Britain to leave the European Union and suggested that country would thrive outside the bloc. Far-right populist challengers in France, Germany and the Netherlands have adopted some of his anti-establishment rhetoric in their own campaigns.

Still, Mr. Wolff said it was unwise to enter into a war of words with the Trump administration. “e need to uphold our values here, but does it mean that we need now a declaration where we put the United States on the same level as ISIS?”e said. “o, I don’ think so. I don’ think it that would be helpful in any way.”

Jan Techau, director of the Richard Holbrooke Forum in Berlin, said Mr. Tusk’ letter was a warning to Europeans not to be lured away from union, or to be tempted away from the bloc by favorable bilateral ties offered by the Trump administration. “e is encouraging everyone to fall into that trap,”r. Techau said of the American president.

Mr. Tusk, by contrast, is making the case for Europeans to stick together for their own survival. “e wants to remind them that there is something bigger at stake than just what they are going to be talking about in Malta,”r. Techau said.

World; Middle East
Papers Offer a Peek at  ISIS ’rones, Lethal and Largely Off-the-Shelf

WASHINGTON —he standardized four-page checklist describes each Islamic State drone mission in chillingly impassive detail: Mission type (spy, bombing, training). Location (city, province). Drone components (motor, bomb ignition). Operation (successful or not).

The form, apparently filled out by Islamic State drone operators in Iraq after every mission, was part of a batch of documents discovered last week by a Harvard researcher embedded with Iraqi troops in the battle of Mosul and then turned over to American military analysts for review.

The documents —n Arabic and English —ffer a rare window into how the Islamic State has cobbled together a rapidly advancing armed drone program that increasingly threatens allied troops fighting the militant group, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL. They show how the group has institutionalized a program using off-the-shelf technology to bedevil the militarily superior American armed forces.

The Islamic State has used surveillance drones on the battlefield for about two years. But an increase in attacks since October —ostly targeting Iraqi troops —as highlighted its success in adapting readily accessible technology into a potentially effective new weapon.

In the past two months, the Islamic State has used more than 80 remotely piloted drones against Iraqi forces and their allies. About one-third of the aircraft, some as small as model airplanes, dropped bombs or were rigged with explosives to detonate on the ground, said Col. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman for the American-led operation against the Islamic State in Baghdad.

Iraqi officials said bombs dropped by the drones, which were primarily quadcopters, had killed about a dozen government soldiers and injured more than 50. “t poses a threat to troops on the ground, and it has value as a propaganda technique,”olonel Dorrian said of the Islamic State drone program in an email. “owever, it’ certainly not a game-changer when it comes to the outcome of the battle to liberate Mosul.”

A new video message from the Islamic State, “nights of the Departments,”ppeared to depict these new drone missions.

The documents were discovered by Vera Mironova, an international security fellow at the Belfer Center at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Ms. Mironova obtained the documents while she was conducting research in Iraq for a book on what Islamic State fighters do in their free time. She said in an interview via Skype that she had come across the materials in a drone workshop formerly under the control of the Islamic State in the Muhandeseen neighborhood of Mosul, near Mosul University.

Iraqi soldiers were not interested in the documents, Ms. Mironova said. But recognizing their potential value to the American military, she contacted the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, which has previously published her work.

Two researchers at the center, Don Rassler and Muhammad al-Ubaydi, reviewed the roughly 30 pages she sent. Confirming the authenticity of documents from a war zone is always tricky. But in a nine-page assessment, an advance copy of which was provided to The New York Times along with the documents themselves, the authors concluded the materials were genuine based on where and how Ms. Mironova obtained them and the center’ experience working with an array of captured battlefield material.

All of the documents appear to be from around 2015 —he early phases of the drone program —nd the collection includes a mix of official Islamic State forms and handwritten notes, according to the researchers’nalysis.

The materials reveal that the Islamic State, much like its forerunner, Al Qaeda’ affiliate in Iraq, is detail-oriented and bureaucratic when it comes to its operations. According to the assessment of the documents, the Islamic State’ drone unit falls under the Al Bara’in Malik Brigade, a part of the aviation sector of the Islamic State’ Committee for Military Manufacturing and Development.

The standardized four-page checklist for drone operations provided another example. On the first page, drone operators were asked to provide details about their mission —pecifically, the type of mission (there are six options, including “ombing”nd “xplosive Plane”, the militants who were involved, the location and the way point coordinates for the flight.

The second page of the form consisted of a checklist that seems to have been designed to help the drone operators conduct pre- or post-mission checks of their systems and equipment (including “omb Ignition sys”nd “omb igniter RC”, the assessment said. The third page was a checklist of gear in the operator’ “ool case,”ncluding “crewdriver,”“liers”nd “nife.”

The last page of the form asked the operators to note whether their mission had succeeded or failed. It also provided space for the operators to write notes, perhaps to document lessons learned from failed missions or interesting events that occurred during successful ones, the assessment said.

The documents also contained detailed acquisition records, essentially shopping lists for the off-the-shelf commercial technology that the Islamic State is buying.

The lists showed the group’ efforts to buy items like a GoPro camera, memory cards, GPS units, digital video recorders and extra propeller blades, the assessment said. The purchasing lists also highlighted the group’ efforts to enhance the range and performance of its drones, whether bought commercially or not. For example, to protect the transmission of their drone video feeds, members of the group wanted to acquire encrypted video transmitters and receivers, the assessment said.

“here seems to be a list of material necessary to the construction of those drones,”aid Damien Spleeters, head of operations in Iraq for Conflict Armament Research, a private arms consultancy that has been investigating weapons recovered from the Islamic State since 2014. Mr. Spleeters has also reviewed the documents for the West Point center. “o it shows consistency and standardization, certainly with some sort of chain of supply in place,”e said.

American military officials said that the Pentagon had dedicated significant resources to stopping Islamic State drones but that few Iraqi and Kurdish units had been provided with the sophisticated devices that the American troops had to disarm them. The officials said they had ordered the Pentagon agency in charge of dealing with explosive devices —nown as the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization —o study ways to thwart hostile drones. Last summer, the Pentagon requested an additional $20 million from Congress to help address the problem.

The recovered documents offer few clues about how the militants view the future of their drones.

“n the short term, we should expect the Islamic State to refine its drone bomb-drop capability,”he assessment concluded. “t is likely that the Islamic State’ use of this tactic will not only become more frequent, but more lethal as well.”

Make China Great Again

America's rivals and enemies have enjoyed a very good 10 days.

One clear beneficiary has been ISIS, which has spent years trying to persuade Muslims that the United States is at war with Islam. ISIS wants to eliminate the world's ''gray zone,'' the places where Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews live in harmony.

No wonder that ISIS-affiliated social media gleefully posted President Trump's executive order this weekend, as Rukmini Callimachi of The Times reported. Trump's call for a Muslim ban, like his unsubtle attempt to implement one, plays right into ISIS' desire to eliminate the gray zone. The president of the United States himself now seems to agree that Muslims and non-Muslims can't live together.

Besides the immorality and apparent illegality of Trump's order, it's worth weighing the strategic effects as well. Yes, it is conceivable that barring visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would keep out a future terrorist. But it's highly unlikely.

They are already intensely vetted, and previous attackers have generally come from other countries. ''The end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks,'' as dozens of American diplomats wrote, in a dissenting draft memo that leaked. Instead, ''it will be a drop in international good will towards Americans and'' -- because of the chilling effect on travel -- ''a threat towards our economy.''

So any strategic benefits are tiny while the costs are substantial: Trump has just helped ISIS recruiters. He has angered Iraq, France and others battling ISIS. He's started a new argument in the Middle East, which long distracted the United States. Most alarmingly, he has undercut our claim to stand for larger principles -- freedom, rule of law, even basic competence.

This undermining of both American values and interests has been an early theme of the administration. And the ultimate beneficiary is not likely to be ISIS. Although it poses serious threats, it is not a serious rival to the United States. The ultimate beneficiary is instead likely to be America's biggest global rival: China.

China remains far less powerful than the United States. But it has come a long way. Its economic progress and its ambitions, combined with the size of its population, mean that China has become the world's only other potential superpower.

Some degree of a rising China is inevitable -- and welcome, given the continued reduction in poverty that will happen. The big unknown is whether China will change as it rises, to become freer and more respectful of the rule of law, or whether China will mold the rest of the world in its current closed and authoritarian image.

Here, too, the Trump administration has set back American interests.

In another executive order, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Whatever you think about the deal's economic effects (and there has been a lot of silliness on both the left and the right), they were likely to be modest. The United States already has few barriers to Asian imports, which is why some combination of your car, television, computer, phone and clothing comes from Asia.

The pact was more about geopolitics than economics. It was, as the Australian academic Salvatore Babones wrote in Foreign Affairs, ''primarily a tool for spreading U.S. interests abroad.'' Much of the Pacific Rim, including Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia, welcomed it, too.

They welcomed it because they want a strong American presence to offset Chinese power in Asia. These countries have close commercial ties with China, but they are afraid of becoming merely moons that orbit Beijing. They tend to prefer the American model to the Chinese model.

That's why they were willing to adopt American-style rules on intellectual property, pollution and labor unions, even though those rules created some political tensions in those countries.

Now that Trump has rejected our would-be Asian allies, China is trying to put together a different trade pact with some of the same countries. If China succeeds, it will gain more sway in Asia, as will a more bare-knuckle economic system in which copyrights, worker rights, product safety and the environment aren't taken very seriously.

Meanwhile, Beijing will be able to point to Trump's extralegal stances as proof that the United States is just another self-interested, transactional nation. After all, the United States also threatened a trade war when it was unhappy with one of its neighbors and also mistreats its ethnic minorities.

The early pattern of Trump foreign policy is to take actions that have the veneer of strength but are actually weak. It's a kind of anti-Teddy Rooseveltism. Instead of speaking softly and carrying a big stick, the White House is screaming loudly to hide insecurity about the strength of its stick.

The people with the most ability to limit the damage are Republicans who see themselves as advocates of a strong America. Bob Corker, John McCain, Marco Rubio and other members of Congress have enough leverage over the administration, in any number of ways, to influence it.

The question they should be asking themselves is: How do our enemies and rivals feel about the Trump administration so far?

IRAQ MEMO

Relationship Recast as U.S. Turns Away

Hidden in homes across Iraq are gifts and mementos given to Iraqis by American friends. Medallions. Certificates. Toys. Guns. Letters. Countless photographs.

''One of my best memories was that there was an American officer who used to remember the birthdays of my three children and he used to bring them gifts,'' said Yasir Khaleel, who lives in Baquba, in eastern Iraq, and used to work as a translator for American troops.

But he has another memory, too, equally poignant.

''My worst memory was the killing of my nephew, who was just a kid, who had been shot by an American patrol,'' Mr. Khaleel recalled, evoking the close but painful personal relationships that have developed over the recent history between the two countries.

Now, with the inauguration of President Trump, and particularly after his plan to bar citizens of Iraq from visiting the United States, Iraqis are asking: Will this new chapter in this long story be one of betrayals and insults?

For more than a quarter-century, since the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States military has been involved in Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqis signed up to help the American cause, and their own, by working to achieve democracy and stability in a country that had never experienced either.

Through the most difficult times -- when sectarian violence was tearing the country apart, when revelations came of torture by Americans at the Abu Ghraib prison -- there were always the personal interactions between Iraqis and Americans, nurtured against the backdrop of war.

The day he took office, Mr. Trump became the fifth president in a row to bomb Iraq. He has also suggested that he would put more military resources into Iraq, where American forces are working closely with Iraqi troops in the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State militants, to make good on his promise to eradicate the group ''from the face of the earth.''

But in his first days, he also insulted Iraqis, saying that the United States should have taken their oil, and may do so yet. And, perhaps most painfully, he announced a new set of restrictions that would bar Iraqis from resettling in the United States, and even visiting, at least for a time.

''At bottom, it sends the message that America sees Iraqis as untrustworthy,'' Kenneth M. Pollack, a longtime Iraq analyst at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email. ''That they are not our partners. It reinforces Trump's idea of taking their oil; that we don't view them as allies but something much less than that.''

Mr. Trump has explained his executive order as a way to keep America safe from terrorism, but officials and analysts say that it is likely to hinder his efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, given that the United States is leaning on the Iraqis to do most of the fighting.

''It is going to alienate the whole of Iraq against the man, to say to all Iraqis, 'You are not welcome in our country,''' said Mouwafak al-Rubaie, a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser in Iraq.

The issue could also become a political liability for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has spoken optimistically about expanding cooperation between Iraq and the United States under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. It will be difficult, Mr. Rubaie said, for Mr. Abadi to justify to the Iraqi public a close relationship with the United States when the country is closing the door on Iraqis.

''This is going to be a huge embarrassment for the prime minister,'' Mr. Rubaie said.

On Monday, Iraq's Parliament voted to ask the government to respond by barring Americans from the country. It was unclear whether the government would do so, and in a statement issued on Monday the Foreign Ministry was more cautious, asking that the United States reconsider the policy.

Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the spokesman for Iraq's paramilitary units that have been fighting the Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq.

Mr. Abadi's spokesman took a more measured approach, saying that the executive order should not affect security cooperation between the countries.

Henri J. Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that the barring of Iraqis from the United States would work against American efforts to stabilize Iraq once the Islamic State was defeated.

''When you are trying to rebuild Iraq, it is important to get Iraqis to study in the United States, to get training,'' Mr. Barkey said.

He gave the example of the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani, in Iraqi Kurdistan, which receives American funding and on whose board he sits. ''Kurdish-Iraqi academics will have a very hard time to visit the United States, which defeats the purpose of setting up these institutions,'' Mr. Barkey said.

Mr. Trump's new restrictions were particularly heart-rending for the thousands of Iraqis who had worked closely with American troops and made many friends among the Americans. There was no guarantee, but signing up to join the American cause came with an implicit promise: a chance at a new life in the United States, through a special immigration program that Mr. Trump seems intent on ending.

''You have let us down, Trump, and wasted all our hopes and future,'' said Ali Salam, a former military translator. He said he once thought of America as ''the land of dreams.''

Two Iraqis, including one who had worked as an interpreter for the United States Army, were detained on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport in New York. With the intervention of lawyers, the former interpreter was released on Saturday afternoon and the other Iraqi was released later that evening.

Anas Nasir, who worked for an American security contractor in Baghdad, said that the new restrictions had shattered his hopes. His job brought a steady paycheck, but, facing many death threats, he quit and applied for asylum in the United States. His dream was a simple one: to open a restaurant in Los Angeles serving Iraqi food.

''But now Mr. Trump came to destroy this last dream,'' said Mr. Nasir, 30. ''I always dreamed of raising my son away from car bombs and sectarian tensions, and America was the ideal place.''

Facing long waits for an answer to their applications, Iraqis have spent hours learning English and researching life in the United States.

''I was waiting for the day when I would leave Iraq and start over with a new life, free of problems and fear and sadness, and where I can protect the lives of my wife and daughters,'' said Haider al-Kadhimi, who has worked for an American news outlet and who applied for resettlement in the United States five years ago after being threatened by a militia. He said he hoped to move to Utah, a state he had learned about on the internet.

''Unfortunately, Trump has decided to not welcome us and has left us as easy prey for those who consider America as an enemy and occupant in Iraq,'' he added.

Strict American immigration procedures had already divided many Iraqi families, as some members were approved for entry while others were left waiting, or denied. For a long time Iraqis hoped the separation was temporary, but now many are fearful that it will be permanent.

Namo Abdulla, a Kurdish journalist who moved to the United States a few years ago but recently returned to marry, worries that his new wife, who has been waiting for months for a visa to the United States, will be barred from joining him.

Mr. Abdulla wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday: ''Thank you, Mr. Trump, for closing your country's borders on the most vulnerable people. My wife has been waiting for her visa to be issued for months. Please don't say this is going to impact my wife. Please don't say this is going to destroy my life.''

Where the Immigration Ban Hits Home

When President Trump signed a sweeping order shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim nations, the shock waves hit with particular force in those countries' immigrant communities here.

Here's a look at some of the areas where immigrants from those seven countries are highly concentrated.

Country of Origin: Syria. Location: New York-New Jersey area.

The roots of the Syrian community here were woven from silk more than a century ago.

The first Syrians arrived in the late 1800s, arriving first in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and then migrating to New Jersey, drawn by the silk mills in Paterson. Since then, they have established thriving communities in northern New Jersey, spreading from the supermarkets on Paterson's Main Street to the doctors' offices in Short Hills and more recently to the apartments in Elizabeth.

''This is the welcoming street, it's easy to spot,'' said Albert Nouri, 62, one of the owners of the Nouri Brothers Shopping Center on Main Street in Paterson. His market has been there for 40 years, on a street with shops selling shawarma and sweets, bearing signs in English, Arabic and Turkish.

He arrived in Paterson in 1976, trained as an engineer and part of a large family of seven brothers and one sister. Businessmen and doctors, especially in demand after the Vietnam War, left Damascus to be with other family already located near Paterson.

The latest census figures from 2015 show 10,116 foreign-born Syrians living in the New York-New Jersey area, with the most in Brooklyn and in Passaic County, N.J. The older, largely professional immigrants are in contrast to the most recent refugees fleeing from smaller cities of Homs and Daraa, refugee officials say.

Avigail Ziv, the International Rescue Committee's executive director for New York and New Jersey, said that the newest Syrians were growing better connected to other Arab and Muslim groups there, and had been embraced by church and synagogue volunteers.

''In the past year, that has grown and become rich and deep,'' Ms. Ziv said. ''We've seen such an outpouring of support for the Syrian families that have come in.''

Country of Origin: Sudan. Location: Washington area.

Alaaeldin M. Ahmed's grocery store in the nation's capital is about a 10-minute drive from the White House, and it sometimes seems that he could not have picked a better spot to sell halal meats, rice and spices to Sudanese expatriates.

''They love to be in capitals,'' Mr. Ahmed, who came to the United States from Sudan in the early 1990s, said of his countrymen on Monday. ''I don't know exactly why.''

Perhaps, Mr. Ahmed added with a chuckle, it is because the Washington area can feel ''exactly like Khartoum.'' (Khartoum is the capital of Sudan, which is covered by Mr. Trump's order; South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, was not affected.)

Washington and its suburbs have a larger Sudanese population than any other metro area in the United States, which has long drawn Sudanese seeking to escape their native country's political strife. Still, census figures show a population of only 4,621 foreign-born Sudanese in Washington and its suburbs and exurbs. The population is dispersed with many living in suburbs like Alexandria, Va. But it is a close-knit community in times of crisis.

''If somebody passes away in the Sudanese community, you'll find hundreds of Sudanese going to the funeral,'' said Ahmed M. Elhillali, a Sudanese lawyer who has practiced in Washington for more than 20 years.

But Mr. Ahmed, whose grocery in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington is a hub of Sudanese culture in the region, cautioned that the community's social life was limited.

''They work a lot, so they don't have time,'' he said. ''They may see each other on the holy days. Nobody meets anyone on weekends or weekdays; they work seven days a week.''

In the wake of Mr. Trump's order, there were measures of disappointment and defensiveness, with different reactions across the generational divide. Younger Sudanese have joined protests. Some older people are searching for a way forward.

''We're not going to be angry because we know the rules and how this country is running, and this new president told people who elected him what he's going to do,'' said Mr. Ahmed, who, like many Sudanese immigrants, said he supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump.

He added, ''They just care about working hard because they came from a tough country and they came here for the American dream.''

Country of Origin: Iran. Location: Los Angeles area.

The nation's biggest concentration of Iranians is in Southern California, clustered in Los Angeles. Some live in big, ostentatious mansions rising in Beverly Hills, a testament to the wealth of much of this community. But they also work and shop in modest stores along Westwood Boulevard in Brentwood, or in quiet enclaves in the San Fernando Valley.

Many Iranians, like Kazem Alamdari, a retired college professor who lives in Porter Ranch, came after the fall of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after the Islamic uprising of 1979. ''I enjoy my life here,'' Mr. Alamdari, 69, said on Monday. ''A free society.''

According to census data, there were 147,597 foreign-born Iranians in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area in 2015. Iranian community members say that the number is far higher, but that many Iranians resist reporting their whereabouts to the government.

Whatever their numbers, their influence here stands out. Signs scribbled in Farsi can be spotted along Westwood Boulevard. Los Angeles has an all-Iranian radio station. And on Saturday mornings, Persian Jewish families crowd into Sinai Temple for festive bar and bat mitzvahs.

President Trump lost California to Hillary Clinton by four million votes, and Mr. Alamdari said that most Iranians voted Democratic. That said, there is a strong Republican streak, particularly among Persian Jews. David Wolpe, the rabbi at Sinai Temple, came under fire in 2013 for conducting same-sex marriages. Mr. Wolpe said that many Iranians in his congregation supported Mr. Trump.

Country of Origin: Somalia. Location: Minneapolis area.

Naima Ali, a Somali-American caseworker, folds up her hijab to look like a hat while driving with her young daughter. ''I don't want to be harassed,'' she said.

Residents of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood here, at the center of a Somali-American diaspora, have long battled public mistrust as their youth have been targeted by the Shabab and then ISIS, insisting that the actions of a few do not represent many. There were 24,476 foreign-born Somalis in the Minneapolis metro area in 2015, according to census figures.

The Somali-Americans here claimed a major victory this month when one of their own, Ilhan Omar, took office as a state representative, becoming the nation's first Somali-American legislator. But the political landscape under President Trump has them feeling threatened anew, they say, bringing more than 1,000 people to a rally on Sunday led by Ms. Omar at the Brian Coyle Center to protest the president's travel ban.

''It's been traumatizing,'' said Amano Dube, director of the bustling community center, where discarded protest signs were stacked on Monday behind the front desk.

Two 6-year-old girls -- one in a pink hijab, the other in a purple hijab -- laughed as they jumped rope side by side in the gym that housed the Trump protest. The community center provides a variety of programming, including tutoring, after-school care, diabetes workshops, college-prep training and a food pantry.

''It's like home,'' said Ms. Ali, 31. Families are desperately seeking support under the new president, said Ms. Ali, whose cousin lives in Minnesota with two young children, now separated from her husband in Somalia. ''Families are being ripped apart. It's heartbreaking.''

Country of Origin: Iraq. Location: San Diego area.

In El Cajon, a city about 15 miles east of downtown San Diego, local businesses offer an efficient overview of how the community has changed since becoming an Iraqi refugee hub. Liquor stores, markets and barber shops with Arabic letters have sprouted around the Starbucks, gun shops and car dealerships.

In the San Diego area, there were 27,827 immigrants born in Iraq, according to census figures, which are among the highest concentrations in the country. Most are in the eastern part of the county, and the vast majority are Chaldean, a type of Christian. Many of them resettled in and around inland El Cajon, because San Diego's high cost of living makes it difficult for them to live in pricier coastal neighborhoods.

Many arrived during the Iraq War, and another wave came as ISIS persecuted Christians in Iraq.

In November, part of the city, along with much of San Diego's inland, rural and conservative East County, voted for Mr. Trump. A cluster in the center of El Cajon voted for Mrs. Clinton.

Chaldeans were not among them. They tended to support Mr. Trump, said Noori Barka, a businessman who moved to San Diego from Iraq in the 1980s. Mr. Barka, a community leader who runs a Chaldean-language news outlet and heads a Chaldean-focused nongovernmental organization, said that Chaldeans felt neglected by President Barack Obama's response to the humanitarian crisis caused by ISIS. They wished more refugee spots had been allotted to Christians, he said.

Mr. Barka, who owns a biotechnology firm that employs 45 people, supports Mr. Trump's temporary ban on refugees.

''I think it's a good idea to stop the program and look at it more carefully,'' he said.

The ban on visas, however, will hurt businesses, he said. He was supposed to meet with a distributor from the Middle East who will no longer be able to come.

''I hope our president understands, because he's a businessman, that we cannot stop doing business,'' Mr. Barka said.

Country of Origin: Yemen. Location: Detroit area.

In the Detroit area, there are 11,247 foreign-born Yemenis, one of the highest concentrations in the United States. Many are working-class, building cars at the nearby Ford Rouge complex or working as clerks at gas stations. Some are merchants who own convenience stores and cafes.

It is unknown when Yemenis began arriving here, but it is believed to have been in the late 1880s. Some gained citizenship by fighting in World War I or II, then traveled to cities like Dearborn, Mich., to work in factories or set up shop.

Anees Aljahmi, 38, co-owns a popular Yemeni eatery in Dearborn, Sheeba Restaurant. He is following the path of his father, a restaurateur who came to the United States from Yemen in 1976.

Right now, he said, the community is ''terrified.'' They are commiserating in places like hookah cafes and the Yemen American Cultural Center. They are also flocking to his restaurant, picking at dishes like lamb haneeth and seltah, served in a traditional stone bowl.

''They came here for a better life and to escape conditions in Yemen, which have never been worse,'' Mr. Aljahmi said. ''Now, they're worried about being able to go over there and visit their families, because if they leave, they don't know if they can get back.''

A close friend, he said, is very upset about having to cancel his plane ticket.

''And families in Yemen have kids here, and suddenly they can't come,'' Mr. Aljahmi added. ''And we cannot send for them. We don't know if we'll ever see them.''

Many Yemeni business owners voted for Mr. Trump, he said. Now, they feel betrayed.

''I support my president and my country,'' he said, ''but I don't agree with what he did.''

Country of Origin: Libya.

The first waves of immigrants from Libya came here in the early 1970s, after the rise of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the 27-year-old junior military officer who took power in a bloodless coup in 1969. Their numbers have grown, largely because of political uncertainty and instability at home, but there is no dominant center for the relatively small diaspora.

Many of these first immigrants were pursuing advanced degrees, said Aiman Tarsin, a member of the board of directors of the Libyan American Organization. But as Qaddafi's grip tightened, Mr. Tarsin said, ''student visas, for many Libyans, turned into political asylum visas.''

He said that over the decades, as the human rights situation in the country deteriorated, more Libyans began to flee.

From 2008 to 2012, according to a census report, there were about 9,000 people living in the United States who were born in Libya. But the Arab Spring, which swept into Libya in 2011 and ended in the killing of Qaddafi by his own countrymen, sent the country spiraling into civil war and significantly increased the number of people leaving for the United States. Mr. Tarsin added that the largest populations lived in the greater metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Washington.

To Defeat  ISIS , Arm the Syrian Kurds

When President Trump presides over his first meeting of the National Security Council, possibly this week, he is likely to confront a decision whose urgency is matched only by its complexity: whether to arm Syrian Kurdish fighters poised to liberate the Islamic State's Syrian stronghold in Raqqa.

Taking back Raqqa, along with Mosul in Iraq -- where Iraqi forces backed by the United States-led coalition have freed about half of the city -- will effectively eliminate the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate. The consequences for the Islamic State will be devastating. It will no longer control significant territory within which to train and harbor foreign fighters or exploit resources. It will lose the foundation of its most compelling narrative: the construction of an actual state.

As the noose around the Islamic State tightens, it has tried to adapt by plotting, inspiring or taking responsibility for indiscriminate attacks around the world: a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., a promenade in Nice, France, a cafe in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a square in Istanbul. Recruits are being told to stay home and attack there. Foreign fighters are being pushed out of Iraq and Syria, back to where they came from. The Islamic State directs its external operations from Raqqa. Hence, the urgency of Raqqa's liberation.

The only fighters capable of seizing Raqqa belong to our most effective partner on the ground -- the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mixture of Arabs and Kurds dominated by the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish militia. The S.D.F. can succeed only if it is armed to overcome the Islamic State's ferocious urban resistance of snipers, suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices.

In the last days of the Obama administration, the Pentagon said it would immediately seek permission from President Trump to do just that. It rightly wants to take advantage of the S.D.F.'s momentum in isolating Raqqa.

It is also determined to get the several hundred Special Operations forces President Barack Obama ordered into Syria the most effective partners possible.

So what's the rub? Turkey -- a NATO ally and key player in Syria -- passionately opposes any American support to the Syrian Kurds, especially the protection units. It is angered by the militia's links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K., a terrorist group that has plagued Turkey for decades.

The end of a cease-fire between the Turkish government and the P.K.K. has produced repeated attacks by the Kurdish group and a scorched-earth campaign by the government. Ankara argues that any aid the United States gives the People's Protection Units militia will end up in the hands of the P.K.K. and be used to murder Turkish civilians.

As deputy secretary of state, I spent hours with my Turkish counterparts trying to find a modus vivendi for continuing American support to the Syrian Democratic Forces. At every juncture -- from the liberation of Manbij in northeastern Syria to the isolation of Raqqa -- they protested angrily and threatened repercussions, including denying the international coalition access to Incirlik air base and slowing counterterrorism cooperation. Anti-American rhetoric surged in the Turkish media. Each time, it took President Obama's direct engagement with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to smooth the way just enough to keep going.

If President Trump approves the Pentagon's recommendation to arm the S.D.F., it will fall to him to keep Mr. Erdogan onboard -- a first, highly charged test of his diplomatic skills. There is an art to this deal.

First, Mr. Trump should make clear that he has no more urgent priority than defeating the Islamic State -- and that Raqqa cannot wait. Pushing the pause button in the illusory search for an alternative liberation force more amenable to Turkey would delay any move on Raqqa for months.

Second, any support we provide the Syrian Democratic Forces should be mission-specific -- just enough to do the job in Raqqa, not enough to risk spillover to the P.K.K. United States Special Operations forces will have to ensure the S.D.F. is using resources only for its intended purpose.

We should insist that it commit to not use any weapons against Turkey, to cede liberated Raqqa to local forces, to respect Syria's territorial integrity and to dissociate itself from the P.K.K.

Third, keeping the S.D.F. focused on Raqqa keeps it away from the Turkish-Syrian border -- and any effort by Syrian Kurds to join the area they control in a contiguous Kurdish region or state. Turkish troops entered Syria to prevent the emergence of such a state. President Trump should clearly reiterate our own opposition to such a development.

Fourth, Turkey wants to take back the Islamic State-controlled town of Al Bab before the Syrian Kurds do. President Trump should back strong American air support for the Turkish operation there and reiterate our determination to help Turkey consolidate a broader buffer zone in northern Syria.

Fifth, Mr. Trump should double down on support for Turkey's fight against the P.K.K., including helping find the group's leadership holed up in Iraq's Qandil Mountains.

Finally, the president must rethink last week's executive order on immigration. At the very moment the Islamic State is on its heels, the order risks becoming a recruitment bonanza for jihadists while shutting America's doors to the very people taking the fight to the Islamic State on the ground.

Make China Great Again

America’ rivals and enemies have enjoyed a very good 10 days.

One clear beneficiary has been ISIS, which has spent years trying to persuade Muslims that the United States is at war with Islam. ISIS wants to eliminate the world’ “ray zone,” the places where Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews live in harmony.

No wonder that ISIS-affiliated social media gleefully posted President Trump’ executive order this weekend, as Rukmini Callimachi of The Times reported. Trump’ call for a Muslim ban, like his unsubtle attempt to implement one, plays right into ISIS’esire to eliminate the gray zone. The president of the United States himself now seems to agree that Muslims and non-Muslims can’ live together.

Besides the immorality and apparent illegality of Trump’ order, it’ worth weighing the strategic effects as well. Yes, it is conceivable that barring visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would keep out a future terrorist. But it’ highly unlikely.

They are already intensely vetted, and previous attackers have generally come from other countries. “he end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks,”s dozens of American diplomats wrote, in a dissenting draft memo that leaked. Instead, “t will be a drop in international good will towards Americans and”—ecause of the chilling effect on travel —“ threat towards our economy.”

So any strategic benefits are tiny while the costs are substantial: Trump has just helped ISIS recruiters. He has angered Iraq, France and others battling ISIS. He’ started a new argument in the Middle East, which long distracted the United States. Most alarmingly, he has undercut our claim to stand for larger principles —reedom, rule of law, even basic competence.

This undermining of both American values and interests has been an early theme of the administration. And the ultimate beneficiary is not likely to be ISIS. Although it poses serious threats, it is not a serious rival to the United States. The ultimate beneficiary is instead likely to be America’ biggest global rival: China.

China remains far less powerful than the United States. But it has come a long way. Its economic progress and its ambitions, combined with the size of its population, mean that China has become the world’ only other potential superpower.

Some degree of a rising China is inevitable —nd welcome, given the continued reduction in poverty that will happen. The big unknown is whether China will change as it rises, to become freer and more respectful of the rule of law, or whether China will mold the rest of the world in its current closed and authoritarian image.

Here, too, the Trump administration has set back American interests.

In another executive order, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Whatever you think about the deal’ economic effects (and there has been a lot of silliness on both the left and the right), they were likely to be modest. The United States already has few barriers to Asian imports, which is why some combination of your car, television, computer, phone and clothing comes from Asia.

The pact was more about geopolitics than economics. It was, as the Australian academic Salvatore Babones wrote in Foreign Affairs, “rimarily a tool for spreading U.S. interests abroad.”uch of the Pacific Rim, including Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia, welcomed it, too.

They welcomed it because they want a strong American presence to offset Chinese power in Asia. These countries have close commercial ties with China, but they are afraid of becoming merely moons that orbit Beijing. They tend to prefer the American model to the Chinese model.

That’ why they were willing to adopt American-style rules on intellectual property, pollution and labor unions, even though those rules created some political tensions in those countries.

Now that Trump has rejected our would-be Asian allies, China is trying to put together a different trade pact with some of the same countries. If China succeeds, it will gain more sway in Asia, as will a more bare-knuckle economic system in which copyrights, worker rights, product safety and the environment aren’ taken very seriously.

Meanwhile, Beijing will be able to point to Trump’ extralegal stances as proof that the United States is just another self-interested, transactional nation. After all, the United States also threatened a trade war when it was unhappy with one of its neighbors and also mistreats its ethnic minorities.

The early pattern of Trump foreign policy is to take actions that have the veneer of strength but are actually weak. It’ a kind of anti-Teddy Rooseveltism. Instead of speaking softly and carrying a big stick, the White House is screaming loudly to hide insecurity about the strength of its stick.

The people with the most ability to limit the damage are Republicans who see themselves as advocates of a strong America. Bob Corker, John McCain, Marco Rubio and other members of Congress have enough leverage over the administration, in any number of ways, to influence it.

The question they should be asking themselves is: How do our enemies and rivals feel about the Trump administration so far?

Where Immigrants From Banned Nations Live in the U.S.

When President Trump signed a sweeping order shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim nations, the shock waves hit with particular force in those countries’mmigrant communities here.

Here’ a look at some of the areas where immigrants from those seven countries are highly concentrated.

Country of Origin: Syria. Location: New York-New Jersey area.

The roots of the Syrian community here were woven from silk more than a century ago.

The first Syrians arrived in the late 1800s, arriving first in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and then migrating to New Jersey, drawn by the silk mills in Paterson. Since then, they have established thriving communities in northern New Jersey, spreading from the supermarkets on Paterson’ Main Street to the doctors’ffices in Short Hills and more recently to the apartments in Elizabeth.

“his is the welcoming street, it’ easy to spot,”aid Albert Nouri, 62, one of the owners of the Nouri Brothers Shopping Center on Main Street in Paterson. His market has been there for 40 years, on a street with shops selling shawarma and sweets, bearing signs in English, Arabic and Turkish.

He arrived in Paterson in 1976, trained as an engineer and part of a large family of seven brothers and one sister. Businessmen and doctors, especially in demand after the Vietnam War, left Damascus to be with other family already located near Paterson.

The latest census figures from 2015 show 10,116 foreign-born Syrians living in the New York-New Jersey area, with the most in Brooklyn and in Passaic County, N.J. The older, largely professional immigrants are in contrast to the most recent refugees fleeing from smaller cities of Homs and Daraa, refugee officials say.

Avigail Ziv, the International Rescue Committee’ executive director for New York and New Jersey, said that the newest Syrians were growing better connected to other Arab and Muslim groups there, and had been embraced by church and synagogue volunteers.

“n the past year, that has grown and become rich and deep,”s. Ziv said. “e’e seen such an outpouring of support for the Syrian families that have come in.”

Country of Origin: Sudan. Location: Washington area.

Alaaeldin M. Ahmed’ grocery store in the nation’ capital is about a 10-minute drive from the White House, and it sometimes seems that he could not have picked a better spot to sell halal meats, rice and spices to Sudanese expatriates.

“hey love to be in capitals,”r. Ahmed, who came to the United States from Sudan in the early 1990s, said of his countrymen on Monday. “ don’ know exactly why.”

Perhaps, Mr. Ahmed added with a chuckle, it is because the Washington area can feel “xactly like Khartoum.”Khartoum is the capital of Sudan, which is covered by Mr. Trump’ order; South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, was not affected.)

Washington and its suburbs have a larger Sudanese population than any other metro area in the United States, which has long drawn Sudanese seeking to escape their native country’ political strife. Still, census figures show a population of only 4,621 foreign-born Sudanese in Washington and its suburbs and exurbs. The population is dispersed with many living in suburbs like Alexandria, Va. But it is a close-knit community in times of crisis.

“f somebody passes away in the Sudanese community, you’l find hundreds of Sudanese going to the funeral,”aid Ahmed M. Elhillali, a Sudanese lawyer who has practiced in Washington for more than 20 years.

But Mr. Ahmed, whose grocery in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington is a hub of Sudanese culture in the region, cautioned that the community’ social life was limited.

“hey work a lot, so they don’ have time,”e said. “hey may see each other on the holy days. Nobody meets anyone on weekends or weekdays; they work seven days a week.”

In the wake of Mr. Trump’ order, there were measures of disappointment and defensiveness, with different reactions across the generational divide. Younger Sudanese have joined protests. Some older people are searching for a way forward.

“e’e not going to be angry because we know the rules and how this country is running, and this new president told people who elected him what he’ going to do,”aid Mr. Ahmed, who, like many Sudanese immigrants, said he supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump.

He added, “hey just care about working hard because they came from a tough country and they came here for the American dream.”

Country of Origin: Iran. Location: Los Angeles area.

The nation’ biggest concentration of Iranians is in Southern California, clustered in Los Angeles. Some live in big, ostentatious mansions rising in Beverly Hills, a testament to the wealth of much of this community. But they also work and shop in modest stores along Westwood Boulevard in Brentwood, or in quiet enclaves in the San Fernando Valley.

Many Iranians, like Kazem Alamdari, a retired college professor who lives in Porter Ranch, came after the fall of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after the Islamic uprising of 1979. “ enjoy my life here,”r. Alamdari, 69, said on Monday. “ free society.”

According to census data, there were 147,597 foreign-born Iranians in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area in 2015. Iranian community members say that the number is far higher, but that many Iranians resist reporting their whereabouts to the government.

Whatever their numbers, their influence here stands out. Signs scribbled in Farsi can be spotted along Westwood Boulevard. Los Angeles has an all-Iranian radio station. And on Saturday mornings, Persian Jewish families crowd into Sinai Temple for festive bar and bat mitzvahs.

President Trump lost California to Hillary Clinton by four million votes, and Mr. Alamdari said that most Iranians voted Democratic. That said, there is a strong Republican streak, particularly among Persian Jews. David Wolpe, the rabbi at Sinai Temple, came under fire in 2013 for conducting same-sex marriages. Mr. Wolpe said that many Iranians in his congregation supported Mr. Trump.

Country of Origin: Somalia. Location: Minneapolis area.

Naima Ali, a Somali-American caseworker, folds up her hijab to look like a hat while driving with her young daughter. “ don’ want to be harassed,”he said.

Residents of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood here, at the center of a Somali-American diaspora, have long battled public mistrust as their youth have been targeted by the Shabab and then ISIS, insisting that the actions of a few do not represent many. There were 24,476 foreign-born Somalis in the Minneapolis metro area in 2015, according to census figures.

The Somali-Americans here claimed a major victory this month when one of their own, Ilhan Omar, took office as a state representative, becoming the nation’ first Somali-American legislator. But the political landscape under President Trump has them feeling threatened anew, they say, bringing more than 1,000 people to a rally on Sunday led by Ms. Omar at the Brian Coyle Center to protest the president’ travel ban.

“t’ been traumatizing,”aid Amano Dube, director of the bustling community center, where discarded protest signs were stacked on Monday behind the front desk.

Two 6-year-old girls —ne in a pink hijab, the other in a purple hijab —aughed as they jumped rope side by side in the gym that housed the Trump protest. The community center provides a variety of programming, including tutoring, after-school care, diabetes workshops, college-prep training and a food pantry.

“t’ like home,”aid Ms. Ali, 31. Families are desperately seeking support under the new president, said Ms. Ali, whose cousin lives in Minnesota with two young children, now separated from her husband in Somalia. “amilies are being ripped apart. It’ heartbreaking.”

Country of Origin: Iraq. Location: San Diego area.

In El Cajon, a city about 15 miles east of downtown San Diego, local businesses offer an efficient overview of how the community has changed since becoming an Iraqi refugee hub. Liquor stores, markets and barber shops with Arabic letters have sprouted around the Starbucks, gun shops and car dealerships.

In the San Diego area, there were 27,827 immigrants born in Iraq, according to census figures, which are among the highest concentrations in the country. Most are in the eastern part of the county, and the vast majority are Chaldean, a type of Christian. Many of them resettled in and around inland El Cajon, because San Diego’ high cost of living makes it difficult for them to live in pricier coastal neighborhoods.

Arizona Man Is Convicted of Helping New York City College Student Join  ISIS

An Arizona man who prosecutors said helped a college student from New York City join ISIS, sending him “own that trail to terror’’—nd to his eventual death —as convicted Monday of terrorism charges.

The man, Ahmed Mohammed el-Gammal, 44, was found guilty after a three-week jury trial and faces up to 55 years in prison, according to a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.

In a statement, Mr. Bharara hailed the verdict as a vindication of the role of civilian courts in such cases, which some Republicans lawmakers have argued should be tried in military courts instead.

“nce again, we have shown that terrorists and terrorist enablers can be brought to justice fairly, openly and swiftly in the crown jewel of our justice system: civilian courts,”r. Bharara said in the statement. He also described Mr. Gammal as an “mbassador”or the Islamic State.

Prosecutors argued during the trial that, on Aug. 14, 2014, Samy el-Goarany, a 24-year-old resident of New York City, had reached out to Mr. Gammal after learning of his support for the Islamic State. Within an hour, Mr. Gammal had shared a documentary film that described the kind of training the Islamic State provided.

The two kept in touch in the ensuing months until, in October 2014, Mr. Gammal traveled to the city to meet with Mr. El-Goarany, according to the prosecutor’ office. Once there, Mr. Gammal provided Mr. El-Goarany with the phone number of a contact in Turkey who could help him cross the border into Syria. In January 2015, Mr. El-Goarany embarked for Turkey.

Mr. Gammal later asked Mr. El-Goarany about the prospect of joining him in Syria, but was ultimately arrested in Avondale, Ariz., in August 2015, according to prosecutors.

That November, Mr. El-Goarany’ brother received a message from an Islamic State member with a letter attached from Mr. El-Goarany, the authorities said.

“f you’e reading this, then know that I’e been killed in battle and am now with our Lord, inshallah,”r God-willing, it read.

Mr. Gammal was convicted of one count each of providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist group, conspiring to provide material support to such a group, receiving military-type training from such a group, and conspiring to receive military-type training from such a group. A sentencing date has not been set.

Sabrina Shroff, Mr. Gammal’ lead defense lawyer, declined to comment on the case.

As of Monday, 114 people had been charged in the United States on offenses related to the Islamic State since the first such arrest in March 2014, according to Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Mr. Gammal is the 63rd to have pleaded or been found guilty, he said.

Mr. Hughes, who followed the case closely, said Mr. Gammal’ lawyers were particularly fervent in their defense.

“t was almost like watching a boxing match between the U.S. attorney and federal defenders,”e said. But, he added, “t was an uphill battle to begin with.”

■ Former President Barack Obama , virtually silent since leaving office, spoke up on Monday, praising the surge of activism against his successor and opposing religious tests.

■ President Trump’ supporters have formed a political arm to support him —alled “merica First Policies.”

■ United Nations says 20,000 refugees have been frozen out by President Trump’ immigration executive order.

Citizen Obama praises protests, slams religious test

Former President Obama boarded Marine One after his successor’ swearing-in on Jan. 20 and seemed to disappear.

On Monday, he re-emerged, pleased with the activism that has blossomed since his departure and pretty displeased at the policies that elicited that response.

Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president said:

“resident Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy —ot just during an election but every day. Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake. With regard to comparisons to President Obama ’ foreign policy decisions, as we’e heard before, the president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.”

Mr. Lewis also let it be known that Mr. Obama never, ever supported a ban on Muslim immigration. He helpfully sent out this quote from November of 2015, as Congress was moving to legislate a ban on Syrian refugees.

“hen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who’ fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution —hat’ shameful. That’ not American. That’ not who we are. We don’ have religious tests to our compassion.”

America First —gain

The United States got its second America First committee on Monday afternoon.

The first was created in 1940 to keep the nation out of World War II, with its best-known associate being Charles Lindbergh, the aviator who was a vocal supporter of Nazi Germany.

The latest one was created by Mr. Trump’ allies and former advisers, the America First Policies committee, an outside group that will support the president, pushing back on opposition to his stances and eventually running advertisements to support him.

The group is being led by strategists Nick Ayers and Rick Gates, as well as Marty Obst and Brad Parscale, who led Mr. Trump’ digital efforts during the campaign. Two other strategists who worked with the Trump campaign, David Bossie and Katrina Pierson, will work with the group.

“resident Trump campaigned on a bold but basic concept: America First,”he statement from the group said.

“his is a concept the American people both understand and support, but few in the media recognize and many politicians beholden to special interests will oppose,”he officials said. “e will provide the counterbalance.”

The group appears to be officially sanctioned by the Trump apparatus, and came together after bitter debate among factions during the campaign. It is expected to be funded in part by the father-daughter donors Rebekah and Bob Mercer, two supporters of Mr. Trump’ chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his counselor, Kellyanne Conway.

The phrase “merica First”as used by Mr. Trump after he won the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. He used it again in his inauguration address. Mr. Trump has said he was familiar with the negative connotations of the phrase. But he has said it captured his approach to governing.

20,000 refugees impacted by the ban, U.N . says

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  said an estimated 20,000 refugees from all over the world would be impacted immediately by the executive order that freezes refugee resettlement for 120 days. Many more Syrian refugees are affected by the indefinite suspension of resettlement of Syrians.

The statement pointed to a provision in international law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion or nationality. The executive order bars nationals of seven countries, including Syria. “he High Commissioner underlines once again”he organization’ “osition that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,”he statement read.

"Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under #humanrights  law" - @UNHumanRights  Chief #Zeid  Chief pic.twitter.com/EpYpEpyYrf  —N Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) January 30, 2017  —N Human Rights (@UNHumanRights)

It didn’ help that the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’d Al Hussein , is a Jordanian —nd Jordan’ king, Abdullah II, is in Washington.

The refugee agency is mandated to protect the rights of refugees. It also relies on the United States for 40 percent of its funding.

The agency said it was “larmed at the impact”f the executive order.

Those who are referred for resettlement, it said, “re the most vulnerable —uch as people needing urgent medical assistance, survivors of torture, and women and girls at risk. The new homes provided by resettlement countries are lifesaving for people who have no other options.”

United Nations officials in charge of preparing refugees for resettlement were told by the State Department on Sunday morning to plan on halting medical screenings, travel schedules and orientation sessions for all refugees in the pipeline for resettlement to the United States.

The guidance went on to explain that nationals of seven prohibited countries would not be allowed to board planes for the United States.

The backlash continues to grow

Iran has banned visas for Americans. Iraq’ Parliament appears to be following suit.

Career foreign service officers have drafted a stinging dissent , declaring, “e are better than this ban.”

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault , visiting the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Monday, declared, “t’ discrimination. We want an urgent clarification as soon as possible from the Americans.”

“his has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.”

And then there’ this:

Unintended consequences have a way of getting out of hand when policies are made a bit hastily.

People are speaking out —hrough The New York Times

The reaction to President Trump’ executive order on immigration was unusual by at least one standard —t attracted more comments than any article in nytimes.com  history.

Judge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide  received 10,363 comment submissions. Of those, 8,448 were approved by the journalists who moderate comments and posted on The Times’ site.

The story, which was opened for reader submissions on Saturday morning, narrowly outpaced an October 2016 article about James Comey’ surprise letter to Congress announcing that emails from Hillary Clinton ’ private server had been found on Anthony Weiner’ computer.

The most popular comment about Mr. Trump’ executive order came from a reader called tbriggs27 in Longmont, Colo. ,  who wrote :

“s a patriot and veteran I am sickened by this callous disregard for people who are critical to the safety of our men and women in combat. As an American I am sickened by the religious test. We can never have liberty and freedom when we deny it to others. This is unsustainable.”

That comment attracted 324 comment replies and was recommended by 9,178 registered readers of The Times.

A Supreme Court announcement on TV from the White House

The Supreme Court —osseted, cordial and militantly untelevised —s going prime time on live TV, with Mr. Trump announcing on Twitter that he will announce his pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.

“ have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court . It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.),”r. Trump wrote on his personal Twitter account at 8:43 a.m. —imed perfectly to catch the top-of-the-hour news roundups.

The president had originally planned to make the announcement on Thursday, but he had a rough weekend after protests over his executive order temporarily banning migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries forced the Department of Homeland Security to decree that permanent residents would, for the most part, be exempted from the crackdown.

Mr. Trump’ shortlist of three federal appeals judges, culled from media accounts and confirmed by people close to the process, is: Neil M. Gorsuch of Colorado, Thomas M. Hardiman of Pennsylvania and William H. Pryor of Alabama, who was originally favored to be the pick.

I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court . It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

The president has never shrunk from the theatrical aspects of his job.

Some Iraqis May Avoid Immigration Ban

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to send the White House a list of Iraqi citizens who have served with American forces with the recommendation that they be exempt from President Trump’ temporary ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, administration officials said on Monday.

The Pentagon list is intended to address a major criticism of Mr. Trump’ executive order on immigration: that it will stop the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have sought special visas  to move to the United States for their own protection.

Some Iraqi military officials with family in the United States, who have also reportedly been affected by the decree, could also benefit from the Pentagon list, which will also be sent to Homeland Security.

Mr. Mattis was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the executive order on immigration, which temporarily blocks Iraqi citizens from entering the United States for 90 days. Six other predominantly Muslim countries are covered by the edict: Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.

The White House has argued that the temporary ban is needed so that the United States can develop procedures for the “xtreme vetting”f travelers from nations that have been stricken by terrorism. Officials said that the Iraqis who will be put on the Pentagon list have already undergone a stringent form of vetting: serving with the United States military in combat.

Schumer’ a ‘o’n nominations, across the board

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, approached his new job as the anti-Harry Reid: Yes, he would fight President Trump where he needed to, but he made it clear he really wanted to find areas of cooperation.

That may not be happening.

Driven by the executive order on immigration and  by the vociferous demands of the increasingly activist Democratic base , Mr. Schumer announced on Monday  that he would oppose President Trump’ nominees pretty much across the board: No on Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Representative Mick Mulvaney for budget director, Representative Tom Price for secretary of health and human services, Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary, Scott Pruitt for E.P.A. chief and Andy Puzder for labor secretary.

Cooperation, it seems, is over.

“fter the first week of the Trump presidency it’ clear our country is at a cross roads. In his first week in office the president has stomped over our proud American tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees, trafficked in alternative facts, and is attempting to fill his cabinet with billionaires and bankers. What kind of country do we want to be: one that helps the middle class and those struggling to get there or one that further rigs the system in favor of the special interests?”

It might not have helped that Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Schumer for his tearful denunciation of his immigration order.

“ noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with the fake tears,”r. Trump told reporters on Monday during a meeting with small-business leaders. “’ going to ask him who was his acting coach, because I know him very well. I don’ see him as a crier.”

Calm down, Trump says, few were detained

Besieged by criticism, with chaos at international airports mounting and protests proliferating, Mr. Trump defended the aftermath of his executive order halting immigration from the seven countries, saying that problems at airports were the fault of a Delta Airline computer error.

Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,..... —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

Delta  said it fixed its system problems  after a few hours on Sunday night. The chaos lasted the whole weekend.

Also, if there ever was a Mr. Nice Guy, he is no more.

There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

And, the president said, he had to spring the order on the world —he element of surprise keeps the nation safe. Also, he seems to have acknowledged that it is a “an,” term the Trump administration has denounced as hyperbole.

If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the "bad" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad "dudes" out there! —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

That swipe at Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was a reference to the senator choking up on Sunday as he recounted his family’ immigrant experience.

Jewish Republican groups mildly peeved at White House

The Republican Jewish Coalition and the Zionist Organization of America have tried really hard to stay on Mr. Trump’ good side.

During the campaign, when Trump supporters unloaded vicious anti-Semitic invectives on journalists, the Republican Jewish Coalition condemned expressions of hate by supporters of all candidates. The Zionist organization latched on to Mr. Trump’ America First program and backed his conservative, pro-settler pick to be ambassador to Israel , David M. Friedman.

When the White House released a statement on Friday commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day without mentioning Jews, they were pretty quiet, even as the Anti-Defamation League condemned the omission .

1/2 @WhiteHouse  statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay , misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just 'innocent people' pic.twitter.com/OXiFqcPi4V  —Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) January 27, 2017  (@JGreenblattADL)

But on Sunday, after Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, confirmed that the decision to not mention Jews in the statement was intentional, the two Jewish groups were upset, mildly. Ms. Hicks justified the decision by saying, “espite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.”

The Republican Jewish Coalition, not exactly sputtering with rage, released a statement:

“s supporters of President Trump, we know that he holds in his heart the memory of the six million victims of the Holocaust, and is committed not just to their memory, but ensuring it never happens again.”

“he lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi’ final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.”

Morton A. Klein, the national president of the Zionist organization, was a little stronger:

“specially as a child of Holocaust survivors, I and Z.O.A. are compelled to express our chagrin and deep pain at President Trump, in his Holocaust Remembrance Day message, omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.”

Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, did not sound all that apologetic on NBC’ “eet the Press” “ mean, everyone’ suffering in the Holocaust, including obviously all of the Jewish people affected, and the miserable genocide that occurred is something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad and something that can never be forgotten,”e said.

Oh, and he mentioned that some members of Mr. Trump’ family —lluding to Ivanka, his daughter, and Jared Kushner , his son-in-law —re Jewish.

Trump’ other objective: Call it ISIS

Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he had a secret plan to fight the Islamic State. Eight days into his presidency, he seems to have revealed a small part of it.

Call it \b ISIS\b0 .

An executive memorandum that Mr. Trump signed in the Oval Office on Saturday afternoon repeatedly referred to the Islamic State as ISIS —ot ISIL, as former President Barack Obama  and the rest of the federal government called the terrorist group; and not Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the group, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it while standing next to the president last week in the East Room of the White House.

“his is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , in other words, ISIS,”r. Trump said as he signed the memorandum, which called on the Pentagon to devise a “omprehensive plan”ithin 30 days.

This is a big issue for the president. As he said in late 2015, before his campaign heated up:

Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL. —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015  (@realDonaldTrump)

In May 2016, Mr. Trump again brought up the issue, saying in an interview with Bloomberg Politics: “he president of the United States always says ‘SIL.’veryone else says ‘ISIS.’nd I actually think he does it to bother people.”

Rush Limbaugh accused Mr. Obama of using ISIL to delegitimize Israel —aturally. (Don’ ask, it doesn’ make sense.)

In fact, the former president thought the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was more delegitimizing than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , which denoted the territory the group holds.

Well, elections have consequences.

Republicans and the art of saying nothing

Democratic lawmakers greeted Mr. Trump’ executive order barring visitors and immigrants from the seven Muslim countries  with unmistakable broadsides.

To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today. pic.twitter.com/XW7sjmCcXh  —hris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 28, 2017  —hris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT)

As protests mounted and criticism grew, Republicans slowly began to speak out, but most of the coordinated response seemed to be, We like what the president is doing, and maybe he could have done things a little differently.

Take Representative Darrell Issa , Republican of California, who once called the Obama administration the most corrupt presidency in history, until Mr. Issa nearly lost his seat and claimed he had cooperated with Mr. Obama . His district appears to be getting more ethnically diverse, but it still has affluent Republican strongholds that have helped him remain in power since 2003. The statement takes the Republican nonposition to an art form:

“merica is a nation of immigrants. Our country has been built by the hard work of those who’e come here for liberty and to find hope in a land of opportunity. A welcoming America is not incompatible with a strong and secure America. We can put in place a vetting process that the American people have confidence in. To do so, the Congress must work with the administration to swiftly reestablish strong and clear screening procedures so that our rich tradition of immigration is not permanently threatened by those who wish us harm.”

Democrats demand investigation into Homeland Security

Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Illinois’wo Democratic senators, demanded an independent investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security into the way it carried out Mr. Trump’ executive order on immigration.

The call came amid reports that Customs and Border Protection repeatedly ignored judicial orders to release travelers from detention facilities at airports across the country.

“e are particularly alarmed by allegations that C.B.P. officers and potentially other department personnel failed to comply with a temporary restraining order,”hey wrote.

“he United States Constitution means little if law enforcement agents disregard it, or if Americans are unwilling to defend its principles and respect foundational constitutional rights, from due process to equal protection under the law. The American people are relying on your independent investigators to serve as a check against a powerful law enforcement agency that may be violating the civil rights of LPRs and operating in violation of the law.”

Jordanian king will have breakfast with Pence

Jordan’ king, Abdullah II, is scheduled to have breakfast on Monday with Vice President Mike Pence at the vice president’ residence a few miles from the White House. He would certainly like to get a little closer than that.

Amid turmoil over Mr. Trump’ order to halt entries from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the king probably has issues he would like to bring up with the man signing the executive orders. But Mr. Trump does not appear keen to host Abdullah II at the White House, certainly not before Israel’ prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , pays a visit.

Jordan’ king will also be meeting with leaders on Capitol Hill. They are likely to get an earful.

To criticize Trump, senators lean on a friend

Maybe senators are so scared of Mr. Trump that they need a friend for support.

First, on Sunday, Senators John McCain , Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina, released a joint statement condemning Mr. Trump’ executive order blocking refugees, visitors and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Of course, those two are practically their own political party —alled McGraham by some, Jindsey by others.

I'm calling John McCain & Lindsey Graham "Jindsey," as they deserve a combo name like every other celebrity couple. —ohn Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) February 11, 2013  "Jindsey," as they deserve a combo name like every other celebrity couple. —ohn Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang)

Then Senators Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida, released their own buddy-gram, positing “nanswered questions and concerns”nd some general “neasy”eelings.

Sens Marco Rubio & Tim Scott issue joint statement re Trump's immigration EO, have "unanswered" questions & concerns https://t.co/qU6taxg2yZ pic.twitter.com/kvL5ZehZCv  —Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) January 30, 2017  (@MarcACaputo)

Of course, teaming up hasn’ stopped the president from taking his shots, as he did to Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham.

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017  (@realDonaldTrump)

But maybe it doesn’ hurt as much when you have a friend.

World; Middle East
In Face of Trump’ Order, Some Muslim Nations Are Conspicuously Silent

Correction Appended

CAIRO —he Germans criticized it. The British voiced their discomfort. The French, the Canadians and even some Republican senators in Washington stood in open opposition.

But in Cairo and Riyadh, in the heart of the Muslim world, President Trump’ decision  to bar millions of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from the United States was met with a conspicuous silence.

King Salman of Saudi Arabia, home of Islam’ holiest sites, spoke to Mr. Trump by telephone on Sunday but made no public comment. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose capital, Cairo, is a traditional seat of Islamic scholarship, said nothing.

Even the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , a group of 57 nations that considers itself the collective voice of the Muslim world, kept quiet.

Leaders in Iran and Iraq, two of the countries targeted by Mr. Trump’ order , issued furious denunciations on Sunday and vowed to take retaliatory measures. But the silence in the capitals of Muslim-majority countries unaffected by the order reflected a lack of solidarity and an enduring uncertainty about the direction that Mr. Trump’ foreign policy might take in some of the world’ most volatile corners.

Will he move the American Embassy in Israel  from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? Designate Egypt’ Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization? Fall in line with Russia in dealing with the conflict in Syria?

“rump has promised to do all kinds of things, but it’ not clear what he will move on immediately,”aid Nathan J. Brown, a Middle East expert at George Washington University . “obody seems to know. It’ not even clear if Trump knows.”

The lack of unity stems from an old problem: Muslim leaders pay lip service to the “mmah,”r global community of Muslims, but are more often driven by narrow national interests —ven when faced with grave actions seen as an affront to their own people.

“hey don’ have a strong basis of legitimacy at home,”aid Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut . “hey are delicately perched between the anger of their own people and the anger they might generate from the American president.”

Still, Mr. Trump’ executive order —hich froze all refugee arrivals in the United States and barred the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days —as sent a whirlwind of confusion, anxiety and fury across the Middle East and Africa. Refugees have been turned back at airports, families separated indefinitely and long-planned trips upended .

“ thought in America, there were institutions and democracy,”aid Fuad Sharef, 51, an Iraqi Kurd bound for New York who was turned away from the Cairo airport with his wife and three children on Saturday morning. “his looks like a decision from a dictator. It’ like Saddam Hussein.”

On Sunday, Trump administration officials backtracked on one aspect of the  order , saying green-card holders would be allowed to return to the United States. In a Facebook post  on Sunday evening, Mr. Trump insisted that his policy was not a “uslim ban”nd accused the news media of inaccurate reporting. Hours earlier, he had characterized the conflict with the Islamic State in starkly sectarian terms, asserting on Twitter : “hristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!”

In fact, a majority of the Islamic State’ victims have been Muslims, many of them shot, burned or beheaded. Among the Muslims who managed to escape Islamic State territory are the refugees Mr. Trump has now excluded.

In a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited the 1951 Refugee Convention, which calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, according to Steffen Seibert, Ms. Merkel’ spokesman. Yet in much of the Middle East, Mr. Trump is less likely to get such a scolding.

He has drawn close to Mr. Sisi of Egypt, whom he called a “antastic guy,”nd is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood , Mr. Sisi’ sworn enemy, a terrorist organization. In a call last week, the two leaders discussed a possible visit to the White House by Mr. Sisi, whose administration faces accusations of human rights abuses —n unthinkable prospect during the Obama administration.

In his order on Friday, whose stated aim is to keep extremists out of the United States, Mr. Trump invoked the Sept. 11 attacks three times. Yet Saudi Arabia , which was home to 15 of the 19 attackers, was not included on the list of countries whose citizens would be shut out. That reflects the deep economic and security ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump also has a personal financial link: In August 2015, just as his campaign was gathering steam, the Trump Organization registered eight companies in Saudi Arabia that were linked to a hotel development in the city of Jidda.

Pakistan, another country whose citizens have carried out attacks in the United States, also ducked Mr. Trump’ list. Although Mr. Trump had a chummy phone call with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly after the election in November, Pakistanis are nervously waiting to see if Mr. Trump will pull American troops from neighboring Afghanistan.

“here’ a lot of concern,”aid Zahid Hussain, a political analyst in Islamabad, Pakistan. “or now, they want to keep quiet and see how things go.”

On Monday, King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet in Washington with members of the Trump administration and Congress, the first Arab leader to do so since the executive order was issued.

Muslim solidarity once existed. As recently as the early 2000s, most Muslim-majority countries agreed on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sanctions against Iraq. Now, after several regional wars and a surge in sectarian strife, that consensus has been shattered.

Multinational organizations that represent Muslims are viewed as toothless entities. The head of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, which has headquarters in Saudi Arabia, was forced to quit last fall after he made a joke at the expense of Mr. Sisi of Egypt.

In the early days of Mr. Trump’ campaign, the Islamic scholars at Al Azhar, the ancient seat of Islamic learning in Cairo, spoke out against the “mear campaigns being launched against Muslims in America.”ut the scholars have yet to weigh in on Mr. Trump’ executive order, and even if they do, few observers expect them to stray from official Egyptian government policy.

For many citizens of those countries, the docility of their leaders is frustrating. Samer S. Shehata, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar, said that many of his students had already canceled their plans to study in the United States. “ don’ think anyone is under any illusion that if you are a Muslim or an Arab, you’e going to be treated different in this Trump presidency,”e said.

Mr. Khouri, of the American University of Beirut , said the disconnect between rulers and civilians in some countries spoke to the underlying anger that fueled the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. “ven when this American move is insulting Muslims and Islam, they do nothing about it,”e said. “hat’ going to create more anger, and more pressure, in the Arab world. It’ terrible.”

‘ou Have Let Us Down, Trump’ Iraqis See U.S. Relations Recast; Iraq Memo

Hidden in homes across Iraq are gifts and mementos given to Iraqis by American friends. Medallions. Certificates. Toys. Guns. Letters. Countless photographs.

“ne of my best memories was that there was an American officer who used to remember the birthdays of my three children and he used to bring them gifts,”aid Yasir Khaleel, who lives in Baquba, in eastern Iraq, and used to work as a translator for American troops.

But he has another memory, too, equally poignant.

“y worst memory was the killing of my nephew, who was just a kid, who had been shot by an American patrol,”r. Khaleel recalled, evoking the close but painful personal relationships that have developed over the recent history between the two countries.

Now, with the inauguration of President Trump, and particularly after his plan to bar citizens of Iraq from visiting the United States, Iraqis are asking: Will this new chapter in this long story be one of betrayals and insults?

For more than a quarter-century, since the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States military has been involved in Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqis signed up to help the American cause, and their own, by working to achieve democracy and stability in a country that had never experienced either.

Through the most difficult times —hen sectarian violence was tearing the country apart, when revelations came of torture by Americans at the Abu Ghraib prison —here were always the personal interactions between Iraqis and Americans, nurtured against the backdrop of war.

The day he took office, Mr. Trump became the fifth president in a row to bomb Iraq. He has also suggested that he would put more military resources into Iraq, where American forces are working closely with Iraqi troops in the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State militants, to make good on his promise to eradicate the group “rom the face of the earth.”

But in his first days, he also insulted Iraqis, saying that the United States should have taken their oil, and may do so yet. And, perhaps most painfully, he announced a new set of restrictions that would bar Iraqis from resettling in the United States, and even visiting, at least for a time.

“t bottom, it sends the message that America sees Iraqis as untrustworthy,”Kenneth M. Pollack, a longtime Iraq analyst at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email. “hat they are not our partners. It reinforces Trump’ idea of taking their oil; that we don’ view them as allies but something much less than that.”

Mr. Trump has explained his executive order as a way to keep America safe from terrorism, but officials and analysts say that it is likely to hinder his efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, given that the United States is leaning on the Iraqis to do most of the fighting.

“t is going to alienate the whole of Iraq against the man, to say to all Iraqis, ‘ou are not welcome in our country,’”aid Mouwafak al-Rubaie, a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser in Iraq.

The issue could also become a political liability for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has spoken optimistically about expanding cooperation between Iraq and the United States under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. It will be difficult, Mr. Rubaie said, for Mr. Abadi to justify to the Iraqi public a close relationship with the United States when the country is closing the door on Iraqis.

“his is going to be a huge embarrassment for the prime minister,”r. Rubaie said.

On Monday, Iraq’ Parliament voted to ask the government to respond by barring Americans from the country. It was unclear whether the government would do so, and in a statement issued on Monday the Foreign Ministry was more cautious, asking that the United States reconsider the policy.

Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the spokesman for Iraq’ paramilitary units that have been fighting the Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq.

Mr. Abadi’ spokesman took a more measured approach, saying that the executive order should not affect security cooperation between the countries.

Henri J. Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that the barring of Iraqis from the United States would work against American efforts to stabilize Iraq once the Islamic State was defeated.

“hen you are trying to rebuild Iraq, it is important to get Iraqis to study in the United States, to get training,”r. Barkey said.

He gave the example of the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani, in Iraqi Kurdistan, which receives American funding and on whose board he sits. “urdish-Iraqi academics will have a very hard time to visit the United States, which defeats the purpose of setting up these institutions,”r. Barkey said.

Mr. Trump’ new restrictions were particularly heart-rending for the thousands of Iraqis who had worked closely with American troops and made many friends among the Americans. There was no guarantee, but signing up to join the American cause came with an implicit promise: a chance at a new life in the United States, through a special immigration program that Mr. Trump seems intent on ending.

“ou have let us down, Trump, and wasted all our hopes and future,”aid Ali Salam, a former military translator. He said he once thought of America as “he land of dreams.”

Two Iraqis, including one who had worked as an interpreter for the United States Army, were detained on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport in New York. With the intervention of lawyers, the former interpreter was released on Saturday afternoon and the other Iraqi was released later that evening.

Anas Nasir, who worked for an American security contractor in Baghdad, said that the new restrictions had shattered his hopes. His job brought a steady paycheck, but, facing many death threats, he quit and applied for asylum in the United States. His dream was a simple one: to open a restaurant in Los Angeles serving Iraqi food.

“ut now Mr. Trump came to destroy this last dream,”aid Mr. Nasir, 30. “ always dreamed of raising my son away from car bombs and sectarian tensions, and America was the ideal place.”

Facing long waits for an answer to their applications, Iraqis have spent hours learning English and researching life in the United States.

“ was waiting for the day when I would leave Iraq and start over with a new life, free of problems and fear and sadness, and where I can protect the lives of my wife and daughters,”aid Haider al-Kadhimi, who has worked for an American news outlet and who applied for resettlement in the United States five years ago after being threatened by a militia. He said he hoped to move to Utah, a state he had learned about on the internet.

“nfortunately, Trump has decided to not welcome us and has left us as easy prey for those who consider America as an enemy and occupant in Iraq,”e added.

Strict American immigration procedures had already divided many Iraqi families, as some members were approved for entry while others were left waiting, or denied. For a long time Iraqis hoped the separation was temporary, but now many are fearful that it will be permanent.

Namo Abdulla, a Kurdish journalist who moved to the United States a few years ago but recently returned to marry, worries that his new wife, who has been waiting for months for a visa to the United States, will be barred from joining him.

Mr. Abdulla wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday: “hank you, Mr. Trump, for closing your country’ borders on the most vulnerable people. My wife has been waiting for her visa to be issued for months. Please don’ say this is going to impact my wife. Please don’ say this is going to destroy my life.”

David Zucchino, Falih Hassan and Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting from Baghdad.

Quebec Mosque Attack Forces Canadians to Confront a Strain of Intolerance

Correction Appended

QUEBEC —n a world often hostile to migration, Canada has stood out, welcoming thousands of refugees fleeing war and seeking a haven. It has been a feel-good time for Canada, proud of its national tolerance.

On Sunday, that was upended when a man walked into a mosque and started shooting, killing six people and wounding eight. The man accused of being the gunman, Alexandre Bissonnette, was charged with six counts of murder on Monday.

The nation quickly rallied after the attack. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an act of terrorism, and there was a collective outpouring of remorse and empathy. But the attack also forced Canadians to confront a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root particularly among some people in this French-speaking corner of the country.

It was also a wrenching event for a country not accustomed to mass killings and even less used to the acrimonious immigration debate that has echoed from across the United States. Before Sunday, many Canadians were watching the immigration ban there with fascination and, for the most part, disgust.

“uslim Canadians are valued members of every community and wherever they live they deserve to feel safe; they are home here,”r. Trudeau said at a memorial near the mosque in the Ste. Foy neighborhood in Monday evening’ biting cold. “e are all Canadians. Let peace unite us all.”

Yet while Canadian public figures of all stripes closed ranks quickly to reaffirm their solidarity with Muslims in Canada and tighten their embrace of multiculturalism, the killings remained a tear in the fabric of a nation in transformation.

“anada took in roughly 30,000 Syrian refugees in a three-month period —roportionate to the U.S. taking in 225,000 over that time,”aid David B. Harris, a lawyer and a director at Insignis Strategic Research, a counterterrorism consultancy. “hese are dramatic developments in the life of any nation.”

Mr. Bissonnette, 27, who was also charged with five counts of attempted murder, appeared at the Quebec City courthouse looking boyish in a white jumpsuit. He was not charged with terrorism, which under Canada’ Criminal Code requires a broad proof of intent to intimidate the public.

The shooting was the first time anyone had been killed in a mosque in Canada in such circumstances and was, at least in recent times, a rare event outside the Muslim world. The attack was particularly shocking for Quebec City, where the bulk of the population of 750,000 works for the provincial government, universities or in tourism. Until Sunday there had not been any murders in the city for 21 months.

Mr. Bissonnette was well known to people who monitor far-right groups in Quebec, where he frequently commented on sites speaking about immigration and Islam. He was a particularly vocal supporter of Marine Le Pen, leader of France’ far right, when she visited the city last year.

He was a student of anthropology and political science at Laval University, just minutes from where the shooting took place, according to people who monitored his online activities.

“e was not a leader and was not affiliated with the groups we know,”aid Françis Deschamps, a job counselor at Carrefour Jeunesse, a community organization that helps young people find jobs. Mr. Deschamps, who also runs an online group to help refugees called Bienvenue aux Réugié, said he had watched Mr. Bissonnette’ anti-Muslim postings for about a year.

“he minute I saw his picture this morning, I recognized him,”r. Deschamps said by telephone, adding that Mr. Bissonnette used his real name online.

Mr. Bissonnette and his family live in Cap-Rouge, a western suburb of Quebec City that lies in the shadow of a towering railroad trestle. Neighbors said there was nothing remarkable about the quiet young man.

“e knew the family for 30 years,”aid Alain Dufour, a neighbor. He said Mr. Bissonnette and his brother were “ormal kids, nothing indicating bizarre behavior.”

Even outspoken critics of the religion recoiled at the prospect that an increasingly acrimonious debate over rising Islamic immigration may have contributed to the violence.

Kellie Leitch, a conservative member of Parliament who has proposed screening immigrants for “anadian values,”ssued a statement calling the attack “ot just on those gathered in a house of worship but on the very fabric of Canadian society.”

Quebec has had a history of confrontations with the Muslim community. In 2005, the province became the first to explicitly ban the use of Shariah law and, less than a decade later, the Parti Quééois government tried to pass a “harter of values”hat would have banned provincial employees from wearing Muslim head scarves and other “vert”eligious symbols.

Quebec City, meanwhile, is a conservative bastion within the province and home to right-leaning radio talk shows that push an anti-Islam agenda —nusual for Canadian broadcasters.

Lise Ravary, a columnist for the tabloid Journal de Montreal, said it might be time for the debate to calm down.

“ am a very vocal opponent of Islamism, and I realize now that whenever I condemn ISIS a lot of people view this as me condemning every Muslim on earth,”he said by telephone on Monday. “elf-censorship looms for the common good.”

Mohammed Amin, in charge of social activities at the mosque, said the community had a “ordial relationship”ith its neighbors. He dismissed the pig’ head that was left at the mosque’ door last year as “ small incident”hat could happen anywhere.

But other leaders at the mosque said there have been hate letters, and swastikas painted on its door, episodes that led to the installation of eight security cameras.

“e’e had to be very, very vigilant, careful for our community,”aid Boufeldga Benabdallah, a co-founder of the mosque. Of the victims, he said, “he prayed beside us and they were shot in the back because they prayed.”

Ste. Foy, the postwar suburb where the attack occurred, is far from the walled city center, which is stuffed with historic buildings and tourists.

The victims came from a variety of countries of origin and occupations. Azzeddine Soufiane, 57, was a butcher with a shop down the street from the mosque. Khaled Belkacemi, the oldest victim at 60, was a professor of soil and agri-food engineering at Laval University, according to members of the mosque.

Mamadou Tanou Barry, an information technology worker, and Ibrahima Barry, a provincial public servant, were brothers, Radio-Canada reported. Aboubaker Thabti, 44, came to Canada in 2011 from Tunisia and had two children. A programming analyst with the provincial government, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, was father to three daughters.

“ertainly Islamophobia has been increasing for some time,”amer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said by telephone from Montreal.

But he said the attack was nonetheless shocking. “t is overwhelming, unthinkable,”e said.

Ian Austen reported from Quebec, and Craig S. Smith from Toronto. Reporting was contributed by Sewell Chan, Alain Delaquéièe and Rogene Jacquette from New York; Peter Black from Quebec; and Lilia Blaise from Tunis.

Correction: February 24, 2017, Friday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 31 about a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root in Quebec despite Canada’ reputation as welcoming to immigrants misstated the surname of a columnist for Journal de Montreal who said it might be time for the immigration debate to calm down. She is Lise Ravary, not Lavary.

Memo From Iraq
World; Middle East
‘ou Have Let Us Down, Trump’ Iraqis See U.S. Relations Recast

Hidden in homes across Iraq are gifts and mementos given to Iraqis by American friends. Medallions. Certificates. Toys. Guns. Letters. Countless photographs.

“ne of my best memories was that there was an American officer who used to remember the birthdays of my three children and he used to bring them gifts,”aid Yasir Khaleel, who lives in Baquba, in eastern Iraq, and used to work as a translator for American troops.

But he has another memory, too, equally poignant.

“y worst memory was the killing of my nephew, who was just a kid, who had been shot by an American patrol,”r. Khaleel recalled, evoking the close but painful personal relationships that have developed over the long relationship between the two countries.

Now, with the inauguration of President Trump, and particularly after his plan to bar citizens of Iraq from visiting the United States, Iraqis are asking: Will this new chapter in this long story be one of betrayals and insults?

For more than a quarter-century, since the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States military has been involved in Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqis signed up to help the American cause, and their own, by working to achieve democracy and stability in a country that had never experienced either.

Through the most difficult times —hen sectarian violence was tearing the country apart, when revelations came of torture by Americans at the Abu Ghraib prison —here were always the personal relationships between Iraqis and Americans, nurtured against the backdrop of war.

The day he took office, Mr. Trump became the fifth president in a row to bomb Iraq. He has also suggested that he would put more military resources into Iraq, where American forces are working closely with Iraqi troops in the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State militants, to make good on his promise to eradicate the group “rom the face of the earth.”

But in his first days, he also insulted Iraqis, saying that the United States should have taken their oil, and may do so yet. And, perhaps most painfully, he announced a new set of restrictions that would bar Iraqis from resettling in the United States, and even visiting, at least for a time.

“t bottom, it sends the message that America sees Iraqis as untrustworthy,”Kenneth M. Pollack, a longtime Iraq analyst at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email. “hat they are not our partners. It reinforces Trump’ idea of taking their oil; that we don’ view them as allies but something much less than that.”

Mr. Trump has explained his executive order as a way to keep America safe from terrorism, but officials and analysts say that it is likely to hinder his efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, given that the United States is leaning on the Iraqis to do most of the fighting.

“t is going to alienate the whole of Iraq against the man, to say to all Iraqis, ‘ou are not welcome in our country,’”aid Mouwafak al-Rubaie, a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser in Iraq.

The issue could also become a political liability for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has spoken optimistically about expanding cooperation between Iraq and the United States under Mr. Trump in the fight against ISIS. It will be difficult, Mr. Rubaie said, for Mr. Abadi to justify to the Iraqi public a close relationship with the United States when the country is closing the door on Iraqis.

“his is going to be a huge embarrassment for the prime minister,”r. Rubaie said.

On Monday, Iraq’ Parliament voted to ask the government to respond by barring Americans from the country. It was unclear whether the government would do so, and in a statement issued on Monday, the Foreign Ministry was more cautious, asking that the United States reconsider the policy.

Other leaders, including the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and the spokesman for Iraq’ paramilitary units that have been fighting the Islamic State, said that Americans should be barred from Iraq.

Mr. Abadi’ spokesman took a more measured approach, saying that the executive order should not affect security cooperation between the countries.

Henri J. Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that the barring of Iraqis from the United States would work against American efforts to stabilize Iraq once the Islamic State was defeated.

“hen you are trying to rebuild Iraq, it is important to get Iraqis to study in the United States, to get training,”r. Barkey said.

He gave the example of the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani, in Iraqi Kurdistan, which receives American funding and on whose board he sits. “urdish-Iraqi academics will have a very hard time to visit the United States, which defeats the purpose of setting up these institutions,”r. Barkey said.

Mr. Trump’ new restrictions were particularly heart-rending for the thousands of Iraqis who had worked closely with American troops and made many friends among the Americans. There was no guarantee, but signing up to join the American cause came with an implicit promise: a chance at a new life in the United States, through a special immigration program that Mr. Trump seems intent on ending.

“ou have let us down, Trump, and wasted all our hopes and future,”aid Ali Salam, a former military translator. He said he once thought of America as “he land of dreams.”

Two Iraqis, including one who had worked as an interpreter for the United States Army, were detained on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport in New York. With the intervention of lawyers, the former interpreter was released on Saturday afternoon and the other Iraqi was released later that evening.

Anas Nasir, who worked for an American security contractor in Baghdad, said that the new restrictions had shattered his hopes. His job brought a steady paycheck, but, facing many death threats, he quit and applied for asylum in the United States. His dream was a simple one: to open a restaurant in Los Angeles serving Iraqi food.

“ut now Mr. Trump came to destroy this last dream,”aid Mr. Nasir, 30. “ always dreamed of raising my son away from car bombs and sectarian tensions, and America was the ideal place.”

Facing long waits for an answer to their applications, Iraqis have spent hours learning English and researching life in the United States.

“ was waiting for the day when I would leave Iraq and start over with a new life, free of problems and fear and sadness, and where I can protect the lives of my wife and daughters,”aid Haider al-Kadhimi, who has worked for an American news outlet and who applied for resettlement in the United States five years ago after being threatened by a militia. He said he hoped to move to Utah, a state he had learned about on the internet.

“nfortunately, Trump has decided to not welcome us and has left us as easy prey for those who consider America as an enemy and occupant in Iraq,”e added.

Strict American immigration procedures had already divided many Iraqi families, as some members were approved for entry while others were left waiting, or denied. For a long time Iraqis hoped the separation was temporary, but now many are fearful that it will be permanent.

Namo Abdulla, a Kurdish journalist who moved to the United States a few years ago but recently returned to marry, worries that his new wife, who has been waiting for months for a visa to the United States, will be barred from joining him.

Mr. Abdulla wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday: “hank you, Mr. Trump, for closing your country’ borders on the most vulnerable people. My wife has been waiting for her visa to be issued for months. Please don’ say this is going to impact my wife. Please don’ say this is going to destroy my life.”

WASHINGTON -- One American commando was killed and three others were wounded in a fierce firefight early Sunday with Qaeda militants in central Yemen, the military said on Sunday. It was the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump since he took office, and the commando was the first United States service member to die in the yearslong shadow war against Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.

Members of the Navy's SEAL Team 6 carried out the surprise dawn attack, and the military said that about 14 Qaeda fighters were killed during a nearly hourlong battle. A Qaeda leader -- a brother-in-law of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric and top Qaeda leader in Yemen, who died in a drone strike in 2011 -- was believed to have been killed.

After initially denying that there were any civilian casualties, American officials said they were assessing reports that women and children had died in the attack.

The military's Joint Special Operations Command had been planning the mission for months, according to three senior American officials. Obama administration aides had deliberated extensively over the proposed operation, weighing the value of any information that might be recovered against the risk to the Special Operations forces plunging into hostile territory. But administration officials ultimately opted to hand the decision on the mission to their successors.

Mr. Trump, who has vowed to increase pressure on militant groups worldwide, was quickly persuaded that the rewards were worth the gamble, and he authorized the mission last week, military officials said. Commandos waited for a moonless evening on Saturday to exploit their advantage of fighting at night.

As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover, the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province, a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month. The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid ''successful'' and said that it had captured ''important intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.'' He also lamented the loss of the American service member ''in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism.''

The military's Central Command said in an earlier statement on Sunday that ''similar operations have produced intelligence on Al Qaeda logistics, recruiting and financing efforts.'' In previous raids in Iraq, Syria and Somalia, commandos have recovered laptop computers, thumb drives and cellphones that yielded important information about militant leaders' locations, activities and associates.

A United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a ''hard landing'' near the site of the raid, resulting in injuries to two other service members, military officials said. That aircraft, identified by a senior American official as an Osprey that was evacuating the troops wounded in the firefight, was unable to fly after the landing and was deliberately destroyed by American airstrikes. The wounded troops and the Osprey's crew were lifted to safety by another American aircraft.

American officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab.

The raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State.

The Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda's branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates.

Because Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents.

There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Command's statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed.

A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a.m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life.

A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years.

The Yemeni official said that at least eight women and seven children, ages 3 to 13, had been killed in the raid. Qaeda supporters said that Mr. Awlaki's young daughter was among the dead and denied that any senior Qaeda leaders had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications.

Faisal Mohamed, a Bayda official whose two sons witnessed the attack, said it severely damaged a school, a health facility and a mosque.

''I was on the way back to town when they called and said that there were Americans everywhere, so I knew I should not go,'' Mr. Mohamed said by phone from nearby Marib Province. ''My kids told me that the sky was crowded with helicopters and that they saw people jumping out of planes.''

''The last thing they said to me was that the whole town is devastated now,'' Mr. Mohamed said.

Just over a week ago, United States drone strikes killed three other men suspected of being Qaeda operatives in Bayda Province, the first such killings reported in the country since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group's branch in Yemen, has long been seen by American intelligence and counterterrorism officials as among the most dangerous branches of the global terrorist network, and the one posing the most immediate threat to United States territory. The group's leaders have sought in at least three cases to detonate bombs hidden aboard American commercial jetliners. All of those plots were thwarted.

The raid on Saturday night was the latest in a series of Special Operations drone strikes and ground attacks in Yemen in recent years.

In November 2014, helicopter-borne Special Operations commandos and Yemeni troops rescued eight hostages being held in a remote part of eastern Yemen by Al Qaeda's affiliate there. After landing, the commandos hiked some distance in the dark to a mountainside cave, where they surprised the militants holding the captives.

A month later, in December 2014, United States commandos stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended in tragedy, with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.

WASHINGTON -- Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump's party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration.

The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump's temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring legal residents exempt from the order.

But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president's order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained.

More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the nine-day-old administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting.

The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president's team never talked with him about it.

White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325,000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel.

Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. ''We're not willing to be wrong on this subject,'' he said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS. ''President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject.''

The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States.

With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. ''To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,'' he said in a written statement. ''This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe.''

He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama's administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. ''We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,'' he said.

Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the long-running civil war in Syria. ''I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,'' he said. ''My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.''

While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors.

As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from majority-Muslim nations.

In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.

''Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,'' he wrote. ''We cannot allow this horror to continue!''

His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago.

New York's attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was ''in compliance with judicial orders.''

Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained.

The lawmakers arrived after 3 p.m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington.

His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and ''they said we'll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,'' Mr. Connolly said.

''I said that's not acceptable,'' he continued. ''We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That's where the problem is, and that's where the federal judicial ruling is applicable.''

The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to ''claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned.''

The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. ''We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,'' he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York.

The order roiled relations with America's traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she ''is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief.''

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey.

But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did ''not agree with this kind of approach.''

The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries.

In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump's front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans.

''Shame,'' they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie ''Finding Dory.''

''No hate, no fear,'' they added later. ''Refugees are welcome here.''

Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill.

Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. ''This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,'' Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. ''That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.''

Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump's handling of the issue.

''We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,'' said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs' donor network. ''The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive.''

Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was ''poorly implemented'' and urged the president to ''make appropriate revisions.'' Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts.

Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. ''They are sadly weak on immigration,'' he wrote. ''Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.''

Iraqi Local Authorities Evict and Hold Members of  ISIS  Fighters' Families

New York Times journalists are in the field in central and northern Iraq to assess the humanitarian impact of battles between the government and Islamic State fighters.

TIKRIT, Iraq -- Udbais Musa says he punched his son and threatened to disown him when the 19-year-old announced last year that he was leaving home to join the Islamic State.

Ultimately, Mr. Musa lost both his son and his house.

To punish the son, Iraqi security forces evicted Mr. Musa and his family from their home on Tikrit's outskirts on Jan. 4. He said they had been transported by military truck to a windswept displaced persons camp with only the clothes they were wearing and a few tattered personal papers.

Under a new collective punishment policy by the provincial government here, at least 345 families accused of ties to the Islamic State have been evicted and confined to Al Shahama camp outside Tikrit this month, according to provincial leaders. Officials said about 200 other families had been evicted and held in a school and at a separate camp called Rubaidha.

Mr. Musa, 60, now shares a blue-and-white tent with nine family members whose only crime was to have a relative who had joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

Several women evicted from their homes and trucked to the Shahama camp said Iraqi security forces demolished their houses with explosives after accusing their sons or husbands of joining the terrorist group.

The authorities of Salahuddin Province say the punishment against the families of ISIS members is intended to force the group's recruits to pay a painful personal price.

''Our aim is to defy the terrorists and send a stern message to the families,'' Amar Hekmat, the deputy governor, said inside the barricaded provincial government center.

But the evictions have set off a rancorous dispute between officials in Tikrit and politicians in Baghdad. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, in a letter to the provincial governor last week, sharply criticized the removals and ordered provincial and Baghdad officials to resolve the issue.

The tensions raised by the Salahuddin officials' actions cut to the heart of sectarian grievances across the whole country, where tens of thousands of Sunni families have been displaced either by the Islamic State or by government offensives against the group. Even as Mr. Abadi's national government has tried to address reports of abuses by the Shiite-dominated security forces and their militia allies, deep distrust persists in Iraq's Sunni communities.

In an interview, Mishan al-Jiboori, a member of Parliament from Salahuddin Province, accused the provincial security commander of human rights violations against ''the innocent and the repressed.''

The Salahuddin operations commander, Brig. Gen. Juma Enad Sadoon, called critics like Mr. Jiboori ''barking dogs and mercenaries'' and said they should not interfere in security matters in Tikrit. In an interview, General Sadoon did not indicate whether the removals would be halted.

The evictions have evoked unwelcome comparisons to collective punishments, including home demolitions, imposed by Israel against families of Palestinians accused of attacks. Collective punishment is prohibited under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions and is generally considered illegal under international law.

Officials in Tikrit cited extraordinary security concerns for the evictions.

''This is a very difficult situation for us because of the terrible suffering caused by Daesh,'' Mr. Hekmat said. ''We are under great pressure to rebuild our city and impose civil order'' after almost a year under Islamic State occupation in 2014 and 2015, he said.

Khazhal Hamad, the province's first deputy governor, said the removals protected families from retaliation by neighbors who lost family members to ISIS attacks. ''There are hostile feelings toward these people, and these feelings can affect the civil peace we are trying to achieve,'' Mr. Hamad said.

The Tikrit evictions are perhaps a prelude to postcombat frictions in the city of Mosul, 140 miles north, if government forces can uproot Islamic State forces there.

Tikrit is a potent symbol of Sunni dominion in central Iraq. Saddam Hussein was born in Awja, just outside Tikrit, and his palaces still tower over the landscape here. Yet Shiite Muslim militias, backed by Iran and known as popular mobilization forces, led the charge to evict the Islamic State from the city in April 2015.

The main highway into Tikrit is now festooned with posters featuring the faces of Shiite militiamen killed in battle and images of the revered Shiite imams Hussein and Ali. Some of the posters are mounted next to Iraqi government military compounds.

But local Sunni militiamen, along with Iraqi security forces, have themselves carried out some of the evictions -- all targeting Sunnis. Thousands of Sunni tribal fighters had joined the fight against ISIS in Tikrit.

Today, pockets of Islamic State fighters remain in Tikrit districts west of the Tigris River. Security officials said the small militant cells occasionally fired mortars from Sunni neighborhoods where many of the evictions have occurred.

Hussein Ahmed Khalaf, director of the Shahama camp, said none of the 345 evicted families -- 1,111 people -- had been permitted to return home. All will undergo security screenings to determine their fates, he said.

Several of those evicted said security forces had confiscated their cellphones and interrogated them about family members' ties to the Islamic State. They said they had not been told when, or whether, they would be allowed to return home.

Several acknowledged that fathers or sons had joined ISIS, but they insisted that they supported the Iraqi government. They said their children had been removed from school and compelled to endure a harsh existence in the forlorn Shahama camp.

''What is the guilt of my children? They don't know anything about Daesh,'' said Eman Khalil Hamad, 34. She said she and her seven children had been evicted and their five-room home demolished to punish her husband, an Islamic State fighter she said she had not seen for months.

Ms. Hamad said the family had suffered under the Islamic State's harsh social codes. But now, she said, she was abused by security forces who slapped and insulted her as she was forced onto a military truck this month.

Hussein al-Gibory, 55, a Sunni Muslim tribal sheikh and a commander of a Sunni militia force that helped restore Tikrit to government control, said collective punishment was counterproductive.

''It will only turn people away from the government and strengthen Daesh,'' said Mr. Gibory, who wore combat fatigues with military insignia of the popular mobilization forces -- the collective name for militia forces in Iraq.

He said authorities should use ''social rehabilitation'' to convince families of Islamic State members that ''Daesh is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb.''

''We are tribal people,'' Mr. Gibory said. ''We should turn to dialogue rather than dragging women and children from their homes.''

Mr. Musa, the father of the ISIS fighter, said he felt betrayed by his government. He said he had alerted the tribal sheikh in his village, on Tikrit's west side, after his son joined the group, and disavowed both his son and the Islamic State.

The sheikh signed and stamped a letter attesting to Mr. Musa's innocence. But the security forces who evicted him refused to read the document, Mr. Musa said, clutching the worn letter inside his camp tent.

Hadia Ibrahim, 44, a mother of 11 children, said two of her sons -- one an Iraqi police officer -- had been killed by the Islamic State. But she said she and her four daughters were now confined to the Shahama camp after her husband joined ISIS in 2014, she said.

When security forces descended on her home three weeks ago, Ms. Ibrahim said, they told her, ''You are the family of Daesh -- leave!''

Mr. Hamad, the first deputy governor, said evicted families ultimately might be moved to other areas, or even other provinces. ''That is to be determined by security agencies,'' he said.

Some families with Islamic State relatives have fled Salahuddin Province altogether to avoid evictions, Mr. Hamad said.

''Those people,'' he said, ''will never be allowed to come back.''

U.S. Immigration Policy May Alienate Iraqis, Crucial Allies Against  ISIS

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State's stronghold in Mosul: the Iraqis.

Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first.

The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington.

''The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a long-term relationship with Iraq,'' said Lukman Faily, who completed a three-year stint as Iraq's ambassador to Washington in June. ''We hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq.''

Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a long-planned conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq.

The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C.I.A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have ''kept'' Iraq's oil after the American-led invasion and might still have a chance to do so.

More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering ''coalition partners.''

With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5,000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on American-Iraqi relations at a critical stage in the fighting.

''My brothers in Iraq's Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,'' Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. ''The Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?''

The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects.

During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect.

''If I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,'' said Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ''It is totally inconsistent.''

Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada al-Sadr, the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of ''arrogance.''

''So get out U.S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U.S.,'' he said on Twitter.

To contain the political damage, officials said a long-planned call between Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order.

Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it.

Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump's own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.

''The people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,'' said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq.

Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training.

''This executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,'' they wrote in a statement issued Sunday.

The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out ''extreme vetting'' of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops.

''The president's actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,'' said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ''The policies validate the terrorists' claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home.''

WASHINGTON -- A growing group of Republican lawmakers criticized President Trump's refugee policy on Sunday even as party leaders in Congress continued to show restraint.

The executive order Mr. Trump issued on Friday, which targets Syrian refugees and all travelers from several predominantly Muslim nations, had drawn little dissent from Republicans initially even as Democrats denounced it and protests erupted around the country and the world.

But on Sunday, several members of Mr. Trump's party said that the process, while initiated with the right intention, had been too hastily enacted and warned that it could backfire against United States interests.

Two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, led the criticism, saying in a statement that Mr. Trump's order was not properly vetted and that it could be seen as the United States turning its back on Muslims who had risked their lives to serve as interpreters for the country's military and diplomats.

''Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,'' they said, adding, ''That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.''

Mr. McCain also said the plan was carried out without proper consultation of United States allies and that it mistakenly lumped together the country's adversaries, like Iran, with allies, like Iraq.

Republicans have largely supported Mr. Trump's aggressive agenda, but in his first major decision on national security, he is finding uncharacteristic opposition from his party in the blush of his early days in office.

Mr. Trump did not take well to the input, singling out Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter as ''sadly weak on immigration.''

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

But as they day went on, they were not alone in their criticisms. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that while he supported stronger screening, the order had been ''poorly implemented,'' especially for green card holders. ''The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated,'' Mr. Corker said.

Indeed, the administration moved to ease some of those concerns late Sunday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced that lawful permanent residents would be exempt from the ban.

Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, likewise said the order was ''overly broad'' and that the blanket travel ban ''goes to far.'' Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seemed to echo those criticisms, adding that ''while not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one, which is inconsistent with our American character.''

Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, went further, questioning the hastiness of the order's rollout and calling for a re-evaluation of the White House's unilateral effort. ''In my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security and again for this notion that America has always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,'' Mr. Portman said on CNN's ''State of the Union.''

Similar concerns were voiced by some Republicans in the House. Most prominent among them was Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who said that ''it was clear'' that adjustments were needed to the order, but defended it in principle. Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a former undercover C.I.A. officer, called the measure ''the ultimate display of mistrust'' that would ''erode our allies' willingness to fight with us'' and put Americans at risk.

A handful of other Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, also offered criticism, though more cautious, on Saturday.

The Republican leadership -- and senior members of the House -- have either supported Mr. Trump or been largely silent about the order. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that the United States did not make policy based on religion, though his criticism was muted compared with his colleagues'.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan released a statement on Friday praising the order, but his aides repeatedly declined requests for further comment.

Mr. McConnell cautioned against vilifying Muslims who are key allies in the American war on terror. The country, he said, needed to ''be careful'' with how the order is carried out. ''I don't want to criticize them for improving vetting,'' Mr. McConnell said on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''I think we need to be careful. We don't have religious tests in this country.''

As tensions mount, Mr. Trump's actions will be debated on Capitol Hill this week. Democrats pledged on Sunday to introduce legislation undoing them and limiting Mr. Trump's executive authority. And the measure could add pressure to Mr. Trump's nominees to lead the Justice and State Departments, who will probably be asked to offer their positions on the ban.

Some Republicans compared the order to a measure that overwhelmingly passed the House in 2015 not long after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris. But that bill was far less broad than Mr. Trump's order, focusing narrowly on the screening process for Syrians and Iraqis who entered the United States as refugees. That bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate, who argued that it too closely mirrored Mr. Trump's campaign talk of a Muslim ban, and congressional Republicans largely put off the issue during the rest of the campaign.

Mr. Trump's order, which was enacted on Friday, halted the entry into the United States of all refugees for 120 days, barred the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspended for 90 days the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- all predominantly Muslim countries. It prompted chaos across the globe as the United States' borders were sealed off to the affected groups and the Department of Homeland Security rushed to apply uneven enforcement. By Saturday night, judges in at least two states had issued stays preventing the government from deporting certain arrivals caught in the rollout of the order.

Democrats were nearly united in their condemnation of Mr. Trump's policy, with several of them rushing to airports to speak out in defense of people who had been detained and even those representing states that Mr. Trump won voicing dissent.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse the action on Sunday, saying it made the country ''less humanitarian, less safe, less American.''

''It must be reversed immediately, and Democrats are going to introduce legislation to overturn it,'' Mr. Schumer told reporters gathered for a news conference in New York.

Republicans who spoke out were more measured, directing their criticism at the planning for the policy and its carrying out, though their disagreement with Mr. Trump was still clear. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, wrote on the website Medium that the president ''and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it's unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.''

Mr. Sasse said Mr. Trump was right to focus on border security but disagreed with how he was carrying out the policy.

And Representative Barbara Comstock, a Republican whose Northern Virginia district includes a large Muslim population, said that Mr. Trump's action had gone ''beyond the increased vetting actions the Congress has supported.''

Visa Ban Leaves Artists in Limbo

PARIS -- The Iranian director of ''The Salesman,'' which is nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, won't attend next month's Oscars ceremony. The Metropolitan Museum of Art worries that exhibitions, archaeological surveys and excavations with institutions in the Middle East will have to be canceled or curtailed. And the Sundance Institute Theater Program may have to scale back its exchange program with artists from the Middle East and North Africa.

As President Trump's executive order seeking to keep many foreigners from entering the United States sowed widespread confusion throughout the immigration system and at airports around the globe, cultural figures and institutions were calculating how the new policies would harm their art and missions.

''Scholarly exchanges and international collaborations are key to our ongoing work, and we are very concerned that a number of programs we have in place could be threatened, just at a time when the world needs more, not less, exchange and mutual understanding,'' said Thomas P. Campbell, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The executive order, which was signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, blocks entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspends entry of all refugees for 120 days and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely. Artists -- and citizens -- from the affected countries legally residing in the United States said they did not dare leave for fear of being denied re-entry.

In the most high-profile case, Asghar Farhadi, who directed ''The Salesman,'' said in a statement on Sunday to The New York Times that he would not attend the Oscars ceremony next month even if he were granted an exception to the visa ban.

He had planned to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony and to use the megaphone the Oscars provides to call attention to a visa ban he called ''unjust.'' But new regulations announced on Friday presented ''ifs and buts which are in no way acceptable to me even if exceptions were to be made for my trip,'' he said.

In his statement, Mr. Farhadi, whose film ''A Separation'' won an Oscar for best foreign-language film in 2012, said he condemned ''the unjust conditions forced upon some of my compatriots and the citizens of the other six countries trying to legally enter the United States of America and hope that the current situation will not give rise to further divide between nations.''

Mr. Farhadi's film centers on a Tehran couple starring in an amateur production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' and includes subtle critiques of censorship in Iran. The film's screenplay had to be approved by the Iranian government, which also chose the film as the country's official submission to the Academy Awards.

Marcel Mettelsiefen, the director of ''Watani: My Homeland,'' an Oscar-nominated documentary, said the film's Syrian protagonist, Hala Kamil, would not be able to travel to the Oscars ceremony because she has a Syrian and a German refugee passport.

The film follows Ms. Kamil and her children as they seek asylum in Germany. ''It is very sad she cannot come,'' Mr. Mettelsiefen said. ''She is the star of the movie.''

Ms. Kamil has been a frequent visitor to the United States, even giving a speech on the plight of refugees at the United Nations in August.

Hussein Hassan, the Kurdish director of the feature ''Reseba -- The Dark Wind,'' which was to have its North American premiere at the Miami Film Festival next month, said he had withdrawn his visa application to protest Mr. Trump's policy.

The film's producer and one of its screenwriters, Mehmet Aktas, said the movie, a drama about a bride-to-be who survives an attack by ISIS on her village, showed that not all Muslims are terrorists. Festival organizers have said they still planned to show ''The Dark Wind.''

Philip Himberg, the artistic director of the Sundance Institute Theater Program, said he feared the visa ban would shut down a fruitful workshop exchange for theater professionals from the Middle East and North Africa. Since it started in 2012, about 60 Arabic-language professionals have attended the workshops in Utah, Wyoming, Berlin and Morocco.

''It shatters my heart,'' Mr. Himberg said. He added that the program was supported by a grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Trust, and the Sundance Institute didn't know what would happen if the artists the grant was intended to bring to the United States could no longer travel there.

The ban is also expected to affect museums. Curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art said the order could disrupt or limit its loans to and from the affected countries and would restrict travel by colleagues and artists to the United States for education, research, fellowships, workshops, conferences and other training. They said it might also scuttle their hoped-for archaeological surveys and excavations in partnership with Iraq and Iran, and a joint publication project on Nishapur with Iran.

Mr. Trump's move is ''particularly ironic, given that the earliest formulation of what we recognize today as the concept of habeas corpus was expressed in the Codex Hammurabi, an ancient Iraqi monument about justice, set up in public so that all citizens could access their rights,'' said Kim Benzel, the curator in charge of the museum's Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art.

''It was one of the many contributions of Iraq to the world, and in this case, to democracy itself,'' she added. ''Where and how did things go so wrong?''

A spokeswoman from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said: ''We have no idea yet how this might affect us, but we do have at least one important exhibition of art mostly from Iran that would be impacted by travel restrictions that would make it difficult to do research and work with artists and authors, as well as borrow works of art that would require couriers from collections in Iran.''

President Trump's order has already complicated a coming production of ''Hamlet'' by Waterwell, a nonprofit theater in New York. One of the actors, Mohammad Aghebatian, an Iranian citizen who trained at Yale, is now in Iran and uncertain whether he will be allowed to return to the United States.

''This is completely and utterly un-American,'' said Arian Moayed, an actor who is a founder and an artistic director of Waterwell. ''He doesn't know what to do -- we're trying to find him a lawyer.''

Shari Rezai, a concert promoter in Los Angeles who specializes in contemporary Persian music and brings artists from Iran and elsewhere to the United States, said she had six shows planned through June, and canceled all of them three days ago, when she heard about the impending ban. She worried that her seven-year-old business was now at risk.

''Tonight I have a concert in L.A.,'' she said, with an American-born Iranian artist, Fared Shafinury, whose band has some immigrant members. ''I'm just so afraid that this is going to be my last concert.''

Lawyers are struggling to understand what the visa ban means. ''There's a lot in here that is subject to interpretation,'' said Jonathan Ginsburg, an immigration lawyer in Virginia who specializes in visas for artists and performers. He said the language made clear that nationals from the seven countries ''appear to be banned for 90 days, even if they have applied for and received a U.S. visa.''

He added: ''The flip side is that we may not appreciate just how broadly worded these things are until someone decides to interpret them more aggressively.''

For now, many artists from affected countries who are legal residents in the United States say they can't leave the country for fear of not being able to return. Shahpour Pouyan, an Iranian artist living in New York under a green card whose work is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said he would be unable to travel to Toronto for a group exhibit or to Paris for a solo exhibition in March.

''I am stuck here. I can't leave the country and as an artist it means I can't make shows and present my works internationally,'' he wrote in an email message. ''This is such a mess.''

Demonstrators turned out in force and on short notice at rallies across the country on Sunday to condemn President Trump’ executive order restricting immigration.

Protesters amassed in public spaces and at airports to oppose the order, which they assailed as un-American, even as the administration defended it as crucial to improving national security. The executive order, signed on Friday, stranded travelers around the world over the weekend and caused widespread confusion.

In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside the front lawn of the White House to show their disgust with Mr. Trump’ decision and their solidarity with Muslims.

“hame,”hey chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the Executive Mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to spend part of the day making telephone calls to foreign leaders and later hosting a private screening of “inding Dory,”n animated film about a fish who travels the ocean in hopes of reuniting with its family.

“o hate, no fear,”he protesters added later. “efugees are welcome here.”

Among the protesters were some former Obama administration appointees.

Matt Nosanchuk, who served as the White House’ liaison to the Jewish community under President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2016, said on Sunday that he had been in touch with several former colleagues as they made plans to attend the hastily arranged protest and ran into others in the crowd.

“hat Trump may not realize is you have a whole cadre of Obama appointees who are really good organizers, who have been activated and who are not going to stand by,”e said.

Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from Inauguration Day kept crowds at a distance from the White House but did not stop the numbers from swelling through the afternoon, when the protesters left to march to Capitol Hill.

As marchers passed the Trump International Hotel in Washington, boos and profanities filled Pennsylvania Avenue. Elsewhere in the city, protesters carrying signs and candles marched up the sidewalk opposite the vice president’ house, most walking silently and many with children.

At a rally in Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, thousands gathered in protest as nearby ferries shuttled visitors to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.

Asma Shuaib, 22, a student from Jackson Heights, Queens, and a Muslim, said she had come to resist the president’ executive order.

Through tears, she disavowed violence in the name of Islam and paraphrased the Prophet Muhammad: “f you see something that you believe in your heart is wrong, you must speak out, and then act.”

For over an hour, speakers including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Mayor Bill de Blasio and immigrant activists addressed the peaceful crowd amid chants of “o ban, no wall,”“et them in”nd “mpeach.”

As they did elsewhere in the country, lawyers stood in the international arrivals terminal of San Francisco International Airport, holding up signs offering free assistance to those awaiting the arrival of family members from countries affected by the Trump administration’ order.

Several thousand protesters, accompanied by a brass band and drummers, paraded past check-in counters, chanting, “ay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!”

In Arizona, which has taken more Syrian refugees than any other state, a few hundred protesters greeted travelers arriving at the busiest terminal at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, their signs facing the street, visible to anyone who drove in. Many motorists honked, some to the beat of whatever slogan the crowd was chanting at the time.

With a megaphone, Orlando Arenas, 33, kept everyone going. “ell me what community looks like,”e said, and the protesters answered, “his is what community looks like.”

On Jan. 27, President Trump signed an executive order that temporarily closed the nation’ borders to refugees from around the world and to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Part of the president’ order gives preferential treatment to Christian refugees from majority-Muslim countries who try to enter the United States.

By Jan. 28, a federal judge in Brooklyn had already blocked part of the president’ actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But the judge stopped short of letting those new arrivals into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’ actions.

On Jan. 29, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, appeared to reverse a key part of Mr. Trump’ immigration order, saying that people from the affected countries who hold green cards would not be prevented from returning to the United States. But Mr. Priebus also said that border agents had “iscretionary authority”o detain and question suspect travelers from certain countries. That statement seemed to add to the uncertainty over how the executive order would be interpreted and enforced in the days ahead.

What will happen now? Will Mr. Trump’ immigration ban be allowed to stand? Will it be ruled illegal by the courts? Will it make America safer? Or will it do the opposite? Does it uphold America’ cherished values, or does it subvert them? These are some of the questions we encourage students to consider in this lesson plan.

Please be aware that this lesson plan is based on breaking news, so you should consult The Times and other sources for the latest information to supplement the pieces we draw on here.

Warm Up

Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

Ask students: What have you heard, if anything, about the executive order President Trump signed on Jan. 27 concerning U.S. immigration policy? After a few students share, watch the above video providing background on the executive order, reporting on protests against the new policy and raising questions about its legality. Follow up by asking: What reactions do you have to the video? What questions does it raise for you?

At this point, you may want to provide additional context for students with this article, “Trump’ Executive Order on Immigration: What We Know and What We Don’,”efore proceeding with the activity.

Activity

Mr. Trump’ executive order fits into a larger pattern of U.S. history. In 1882, Congress excluded Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. Later it prohibited almost all Japanese immigrants. And still later it gave preference to immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, making it difficult for people from other parts of the world to immigrate to the U.S. But the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 changed all of that. It did away with the national origins quota and banned discrimination based on where a person was from.

However, with Mr. Trump’ pronouncement on Jan. 27, the U.S. once again excludes immigrants based on national origin from countries like Iraq, Yemen and Sudan.

This activity invites students to analyze Mr. Trump’ stated purpose for his executive order (as explained within Section 1 of the text), then consider three pieces in The Times that question its effectiveness, legality and interpretation of American values.

Working in three different groups, students should read and annotate the excerpts below (or the full texts) and answer the relevant question through writing and discussion. Then, the class can come back together to share what they learned.

We have reproduced the readings for the three groups in this PDF.

As a follow-up activity, we point to an article in the conservative magazine, National Review, that largely supports Mr. Trump’ executive order. Students can annotate and read this article, and then hold a debate about whether or not Mr. Trump’ policy is good for the country.

_________

Group One: Is the executive order good public policy —ill it help prevent future terrorist acts, its stated purpose?

Mr. Trump states in the executive order:

Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.

In “Immigration Ban Is Unlikely to Reduce Terrorist Threat, Experts Say,”cott Shane investigates whether the executive order is likely to accomplish its stated goal:

Rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday: “rotecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”ut the president’ directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States, which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001.

Many experts believe the order’ unintended consequences will make the threat worse.

While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence, terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data. For instance, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the seven countries targeted in the order’ 120-day visa ban, according to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina.

Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind —or instance, charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group —nly 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries, said Mr. Kurzman, who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism.

The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States, and the president’ order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame.

There was a random quality to the list of countries: It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated. Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan, where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States. Notably, perhaps, the list avoided Muslim countries where Mr. Trump has major business ventures.

_________

Group Two: Is the executive order legal?

In an Op-Ed, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute’ Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, puts Mr. Trump’ policy into historical context and makes the case that it is illegal. He argues that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. The Op-Ed begins:

President Trump signed an executive order on Friday that purports to bar for at least 90 days almost all permanent immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries, including Syria and Iraq, and asserts the power to extend the ban indefinitely.

But the order is illegal. More than 50 years ago, Congress outlawed such discrimination against immigrants based on national origin.

That decision came after a long and shameful history in this country of barring immigrants based on where they came from. Starting in the late 19th century, laws excluded all Chinese, almost all Japanese, then all Asians in the so-called Asiatic Barred Zone. Finally, in 1924, Congress created a comprehensive “ational-origins system,”kewing immigration quotas to benefit Western Europeans and to exclude most Eastern Europeans, almost all Asians, and Africans.

Mr. Trump appears to want to reinstate a new type of Asiatic Barred Zone by executive order, but there is just one problem: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin, replacing the old prejudicial system and giving each country an equal shot at the quotas. In signing the new law, President Lyndon B. Johnson said that “he harsh injustice”f the national-origins quota system had been “bolished.”

Nonetheless, Mr. Trump asserts that he still has the power to discriminate, pointing to a 1952 law that allows the president the ability to “uspend the entry”f “ny class of aliens”hat he finds are detrimental to the interest of the United States.

But the president ignores the fact that Congress then restricted this power in 1965, stating plainly that no person could be “iscriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’ race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.”he only exceptions are those provided for by Congress (such as the preference for Cuban asylum seekers).

_________

Group Three: Does the president’ executive order uphold the values of the United States?

Mr. Trump states in the executive order:

In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.

The Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argues in an Op-Ed that rather than upholding America’ founding principles, Mr. Trump is actually subverting them. He writes:

This is a country built by refugees and immigrants, your ancestors and mine. When we bar them and vilify them, we shame our own roots.

His Op-Ed begins:

This newspaper has periodically, to its shame, succumbed to the kind of xenophobic fearmongering that President Trump is now trying to make American policy.

In 1875, The Times sternly warned that too many Irish and German immigrants (like the Trumps) could “eprive Americans by birth and descent of the small share they yet retain”n New York City.

In 1941, The Times cautioned in a front-page article that European Jews desperately seeking American visas might be Nazi spies. In 1942, as Japanese-Americans were being interned, The Times cheerfully suggested that the detainees were happily undertaking an “dventure.”

We make bad decisions when we fear immigrants we “therize.”hat’ why Americans burned Irish Catholics alive, banned Chinese for decades, denied visas to Anne Frank’ family and interned Japanese-Americans. And yes, The New York Times sometimes participated in such madness.

But we will not be part of that today.

Trump signed an executive order on Friday that suspends refugee programs and targets Muslims from certain countries. It’ hypocritical for Trump to be today’ avatar of hostility to immigrants, since his own family suffered from anti-German sentiment and pretended to be Swedish.

_________

Follow-Up Activity

The reaction to President Trump’ ban on refugees entering the United States was swift, certain —nd sharply divided.

While the first activity asked student groups to read three articles that questioned the effectiveness, legality and spirit of Mr. Trump’ executive order, there were also voices of support from various corners of the U.S. and the world.

In “Trump’ Immigration Ban Draws Deep Anger and Muted Praise,”ichard Péez-Peñ writes:

The president’ executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically.

Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president’ more narrowly tailored order as common sense. “ feel that it’ a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,”e said. “ don’ think it’ un-American. I think it’ very reasonable.”

Kathleen Ganci, 67, whose husband, Peter J. Ganci Jr., the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order, too.

“ don’ care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,”he said. “ don’ want other Americans to go through what I did —ecause we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.”

And Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration, said it makes sense to suspend the refugee program temporarily, examine it, “nd at least begin to initiate some changes.”

“ don’ know what form those changes will take, and I’ not sure the administration knows yet,”e said.

In an article from the conservative magazine National Review headlined “Trump’ Executive Order on Refugees —eparating Fact from Hysteria,”David French argues that the administration’ new immigration policy is, for the most part, “easonable and prudent.”e writes:

To the extent this ban applies to new immigrant and non-immigrant entry, this temporary halt (with exceptions) is wise. We know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks of refugees and other visitors. We know that immigrants from Somalia, for example, have launched jihadist attacks here at home and have sought to leave the U.S. to join ISIS.

Students can read the details of Mr. French’ argument, and then hold a class debate or discussion about whether Mr. Trump’ immigration ban is good policy.

U.S.
In a Week, Trump Reshapes Decades of Perceptions About America

WASHINGTON —y some measures, President Trump has altered the perception of American foreign policy more in the past seven days than his predecessors did in the past seven decades.

A nation that built its brand around the world as open to the world’ needy and ambitious is now viewed, after Mr. Trump’ immigration executive order, as closing its doors in a way it never did even after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Twenty years of stop-and-go efforts to rebuild a relationship with Mexico —n trade, counterterrorism and drug interdiction —rashed into an avoidable blowup with the Mexican president, who canceled his visit here.

When Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit, Mr. Trump’ first by the leader of a close ally, she spoke of maintaining sanctions on Russia until it met its commitments on Ukraine. Mr. Trump stayed silent. After he spoke the next day to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the official readout provided by the White House made no mention of Ukraine, or of the information-warfare operation to influence the American election that led President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, to issue new sanctions.

Perception is different from reality. It is possible that when viewed from a distance of a few years, Mr. Trump’ pronouncements about “xtreme vetting”nd his rush to push some of America’ most experienced career diplomats out of their jobs will look like a first-week blitz intended to send a message to the world that he meant what he said when he talked about “merica First.”

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to try to soften his action, arguing that “his is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.”e promised to “ind ways to help all those who are suffering,”ords that were missing on Friday when he announced that all refugees from Syria would be barred from entry to the United States, indefinitely.

“t’ one week in,”Robert M. Gates, the former secretary of defense and C.I.A. director, said on ABC’ “his Week”n Sunday. “very administration I’e worked for begins with a flurry of executive orders”eant to distinguish itself from it predecessor.

But Mr. Gates, who has served eight presidents, of both parties, quickly added that Mr. Trump risks accelerating a sense of an America that is pulling back and putting up walls, leaving a power vacuum around the globe.

“hat vacuum will not be filled by benign forces,”e said. Two other prominent, establishment Republicans, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called the lumping together in the immigration order of a major adversary, Iran, with an ally, Iraq, one of many reason that the moves are “ self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.”

Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to announce shifts in policy that surprised allies and upturned the existing order. President Richard M. Nixon’ decision to abandon the gold standard and to recognize China were shocks to the system. So was President George W. Bush’ decision to invade Iraq, though it was telegraphed for more than a year, as was Mr. Obama’ decision to strike a nuclear accord with Iran and to reopen diplomatic relations with Cuba.

But in the case of Mr. Trump, there is a sense that the rush for change has superseded a study of unintended consequences.

The ban on immigration and visitors from seven nations came with minimal, if any, input from the State Department about the regional fallout —s did Mr. Trump’ declaration that he intends to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The absence of advance thinking about how to deal with green-card holders and Iraqi interpreters who were promised entry to America in return for their service to American troops forced the White House to amend its interpretations of the order less than 48 hours after Mr. Trump signed it at the Pentagon.

It was all symptomatic of a new president eager to tweet first and work out details later. “his is policy by thunderbolt,”aid Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who served as the head of the National Intelligence Council and has written extensively on how the United States can gain leverage from its “oft power”—he attractiveness of its culture and democracy. “ou don’ want to tear up 70 years of foreign policy until you think hard about what replaces it.”

But inside the halls of the State Department, where Rex W. Tillerson, the pick for secretary of state, has just begun to find his way around, there is definitely the sense among career diplomats that this is Year Zero.

Last week, the “anding team”f Trump designees told several of the department’ most senior diplomats —areer officials, some with decades of service —o clear out of their offices. Almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that State Department facilities were safe, American citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued.

The Trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (Mr. Tillerson also never met one-on-one with his predecessor, John Kerry, before the inauguration.)

It was not exactly a purge, but the fact remains that some of the government’ most experienced diplomats have moved on —ncluding some of the highest-ranking women in the department. Among them is Anne Patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes Mr. Trump will face. Victoria J. Nuland, 55, one of the department’ top Russia experts and former ambassador to NATO, who dealt with the Ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in Mr. Trump’ administration.

Such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether Mr. Tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of Exxon Mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world’ largest oil company.

In such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves —ike the reorganization of the National Security Council —ake on a political air. On Sunday Mr. Trump’ chief strategist, and chief ideologue, Stephen K. Bannon, was designated a permanent member of the “rincipals committee”f the National Security Council, putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. Meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table.

“his is stone cold crazy,”Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a Twitter post. “ho needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?”he said, using acronyms for the Islamic State and North Korea.

Mr. Trump’ answer is simple: When you have come to upend the establishment, the establishment must vacate the premises.

Trump’ Immigration Order Jolts Iraqis, U.S.’ Top Allies Against  ISIS

WASHINGTON —resident Trump’ executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State’ stronghold in Mosul: the Iraqis.

Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first.

The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington.

“he effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a long-term relationship with Iraq,”aid Lukman Faily, who completed a three-year stint as Iraq’ ambassador to Washington in June. “e hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq.”

Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a long-planned conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq.

The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C.I.A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have “ept”raq’ oil after the American-led invasion and might still have a chance to do so.

More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering “oalition partners.”

With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5,000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on American-Iraqi relations at a critical stage in the fighting.

“y brothers in Iraq’ Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,”ark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. “he Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?”

The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects.

During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect.

“f I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,”aid Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “t is totally inconsistent.”

Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada al-Sadr, the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of “rrogance.”

“o get out U.S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U.S.,”e said on Twitter.

To contain the political damage, officials said a long-planned call between Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order.

Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it.

Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump’ own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.

“he people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,”aid Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq.

Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training.

“his executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,”hey wrote in a statement issued Sunday.

The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out “xtreme vetting”f citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops.

“he president’ actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,”aid Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “he policies validate the terrorists’laim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home.”

In Face of Trump’ Order, Some Muslim Nations Are Conspicuously Silent

Correction Appended

CAIRO —he Germans criticized it. The British voiced their discomfort. The French, the Canadians and even some Republican senators in Washington stood in open opposition.

But in Cairo and Riyadh, in the heart of the Muslim world, President Trump’ decision  to bar millions of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from the United States was met with a conspicuous silence.

King Salman of Saudi Arabia, home of Islam’ holiest sites, spoke to Mr. Trump by telephone on Sunday but made no public comment. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose capital, Cairo, is a traditional seat of Islamic scholarship, said nothing.

Even the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , a group of 57 nations that considers itself the collective voice of the Muslim world, kept quiet.

Leaders in Iran and Iraq, two of the countries targeted by Mr. Trump’ order , issued furious denunciations on Sunday and vowed to take retaliatory measures. But the silence in the capitals of Muslim-majority countries unaffected by the order reflected a lack of solidarity and an enduring uncertainty about the direction that Mr. Trump’ foreign policy might take in some of the world’ most volatile corners.

Will he move the American Embassy in Israel  from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? Designate Egypt’ Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization? Fall in line with Russia in dealing with the conflict in Syria?

“rump has promised to do all kinds of things, but it’ not clear what he will move on immediately,”aid Nathan J. Brown, a Middle East expert at George Washington University . “obody seems to know. It’ not even clear if Trump knows.”

The lack of unity stems from an old problem: Muslim leaders pay lip service to the “mmah,”r global community of Muslims, but are more often driven by narrow national interests —ven when faced with grave actions seen as an affront to their own people.

“hey don’ have a strong basis of legitimacy at home,”aid Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut . “hey are delicately perched between the anger of their own people and the anger they might generate from the American president.”

Still, Mr. Trump’ executive order —hich froze all refugee arrivals in the United States and barred the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days —as sent a whirlwind of confusion, anxiety and fury across the Middle East and Africa. Refugees have been turned back at airports, families separated indefinitely and long-planned trips upended .

“ thought in America, there were institutions and democracy,”aid Fuad Sharef, 51, an Iraqi Kurd bound for New York who was turned away from the Cairo airport with his wife and three children on Saturday morning. “his looks like a decision from a dictator. It’ like Saddam Hussein.”

On Sunday, Trump administration officials backtracked on one aspect of the  order , saying green-card holders would be allowed to return to the United States. In a Facebook post  on Sunday evening, Mr. Trump insisted that his policy was not a “uslim ban”nd accused the news media of inaccurate reporting. Hours earlier, he had characterized the conflict with the Islamic State in starkly sectarian terms, asserting on Twitter : “hristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!”

In fact, a majority of the Islamic State’ victims have been Muslims, many of them shot, burned or beheaded. Among the Muslims who managed to escape Islamic State territory are the refugees Mr. Trump has now excluded.

In a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited the 1951 Refugee Convention, which calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, according to Steffen Seibert, Ms. Merkel’ spokesman. Yet in much of the Middle East, Mr. Trump is less likely to get such a scolding.

He has drawn close to Mr. Sisi of Egypt, whom he called a “antastic guy,”nd is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood , Mr. Sisi’ sworn enemy, a terrorist organization. In a call last week, the two leaders discussed a possible visit to the White House by Mr. Sisi, whose administration faces accusations of human rights abuses —n unthinkable prospect during the Obama administration.

In his order on Friday, whose stated aim is to keep extremists out of the United States, Mr. Trump invoked the Sept. 11 attacks three times. Yet Saudi Arabia , which was home to 15 of the 19 attackers, was not included on the list of countries whose citizens would be shut out. That reflects the deep economic and security ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump also has a personal financial link: In August 2015, just as his campaign was gathering steam, the Trump Organization registered eight companies in Saudi Arabia that were linked to a hotel development in the city of Jidda.

Pakistan, another country whose citizens have carried out attacks in the United States, also ducked Mr. Trump’ list. Although Mr. Trump had a chummy phone call with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly after the election in November, Pakistanis are nervously waiting to see if Mr. Trump will pull American troops from neighboring Afghanistan.

“here’ a lot of concern,”aid Zahid Hussain, a political analyst in Islamabad, Pakistan. “or now, they want to keep quiet and see how things go.”

On Monday, King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet in Washington with members of the Trump administration and Congress, the first Arab leader to do so since the executive order was issued.

Muslim solidarity once existed. As recently as the early 2000s, most Muslim-majority countries agreed on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sanctions against Iraq. Now, after several regional wars and a surge in sectarian strife, that consensus has been shattered.

Multinational organizations that represent Muslims are viewed as toothless entities. The head of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, which has headquarters in Saudi Arabia, was forced to quit last fall after he made a joke at the expense of Mr. Sisi of Egypt.

In the early days of Mr. Trump’ campaign, the Islamic scholars at Al Azhar, the ancient seat of Islamic learning in Cairo, spoke out against the “mear campaigns being launched against Muslims in America.”ut the scholars have yet to weigh in on Mr. Trump’ executive order, and even if they do, few observers expect them to stray from official Egyptian government policy.

For many citizens of those countries, the docility of their leaders is frustrating. Samer S. Shehata, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar, said that many of his students had already canceled their plans to study in the United States. “ don’ think anyone is under any illusion that if you are a Muslim or an Arab, you’e going to be treated different in this Trump presidency,”e said.

Mr. Khouri, of the American University of Beirut , said the disconnect between rulers and civilians in some countries spoke to the underlying anger that fueled the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. “ven when this American move is insulting Muslims and Islam, they do nothing about it,”e said. “hat’ going to create more anger, and more pressure, in the Arab world. It’ terrible.”

Correction: January 30, 2017, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article gave an outdated position for Rami G. Khouri. He is a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute, and no longer its director.
